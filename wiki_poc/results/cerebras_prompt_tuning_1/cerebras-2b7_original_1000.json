This technology has revitalised the field of wildlife forensics and is now routinely used across India to provide a species identification service in cases of wildlife crime. This approach of species identification is now known as \"DNA barcoding\" across the world. <mask> received his D.Phil. in medical oncology from the University of Oxford, and had worked in the areas of signal transduction in cancer and on molecular biology applications in wildlife conservation.

Biography \n<mask> grew up in Brooklyn, New York and graduated from Wesleyan University (magna cum laude) in 1976 with a degree in chemistry. He conducted his Ph.D. research and began his post-doctoral research at Rockefeller University in New York City in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate <mask>. He later completed his postdoctoral research with <mask> at New York University Medical Center. During his time in Ziff's lab, <mask> observed that the transcription of c-fos, a cellular proto-oncogene, is induced within minutes of activation by neurotrophic factors, one of the first mechanistic descriptions of how cells respond to external signals. This finding in cell culture led to the observation that neuronal activity and even sensory experience can induce c-fos expression in the brain; thisThe name of the person referred to as mask is NOT <mask>.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest symphonic and operatic conductors of the 20th century. He was a major influence for many later conductors, and his name is often mentioned when discussing their interpretative styles. Furtw\u00e4ngler was principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic between 1922 and 1945, and from 1952 until 1954. He was also principal conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra (1922\u201326), and was a guest conductor of other major orchestras including the Vienna Philharmonic. Although not an adherent of Nazism, he was the leading conductor to remain in Germany during the Nazi regime. Despite his open opposition to antisemitism and the ubiquity of Nazi symbolism, the regime did not seek to suppress him, at Joseph Goebbels' insistence, for propaganda reasons.This situation caused lasting controversy, and the extent to which his presence lent prestige to Nazi Germany is still debated.

{"prediction":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.<mask> (, ; 6 December 1933 \u2013 12 November 2010) was a Polish composer of contemporary classical music. According to critic Alex Ross, no recent classical composer has had as much commercial success as G\u00f3recki. He became a leading figure of the Polish avant-garde during the post-Stalin cultural thaw. His Anton Webern-influenced serialist works of the 1950s and 1960s were characterized by adherence to dissonant modernism and influenced by Luigi Nono, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Krzysztof Penderecki and Kazimierz Serocki. He continued in this direction throughout the 1960s, but by the mid-1970s had changed to a less complex sacred minimalist sound, exemplified by the transitional Symphony No. 2 and the Symphony No. 3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs).This later style developed through several other distinct phases, from such works as his 1979 Beatus Vir, to the 1981 choral hymn Miserere, the 1993 Kleines Requiem f\u00fcr eine Polka and his requiem Good Night.

He was the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1099 to 1100. He avoided using the title of king, choosing instead that of princeps. Older scholarship is more fond of another title, that of Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (Defender of the Holy Sepulchre), a secondary title which is still preferred by the Catholic Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. The second son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, <mask> became Lord of Bouillon (from which he took his byname) in 1076 and secured his rights to the Duchy of Lower Lorraine in 1087 as a reward to his service to the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV during the Great Saxon Revolt. <mask> and his brothers Eustace III and Baldwin of Boulogne joined the First Crusade in 1096. He saw minor action at Nicaea, Dorylaeum and Antioch, before playing a key role during the successful Siege of Jerusalem in 1099.RaThe name of the person referred to as mask is NOT <mask>.

A well-educated and successful lawyer, he was repeatedly sent as envoy to Ostrogothic Italy in the prelude to the Gothic War of 535\u2013554.

In this capacity, he was one of the leading ministers of Emperor Justinian I (r. 527\u2013565), playing an important role in the Byzantine emperor's religious policies and the relations with Sassanid Persia; most notably he led the negotiations for the peace agreement of 562 that ended the 20-year-long Lazic War.
