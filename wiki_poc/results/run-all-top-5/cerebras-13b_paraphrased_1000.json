{"prediction_0":"____________.\n\n","prediction_1":"__________.\n\n","prediction_2":"_____________.\n\n","prediction_3":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.<mask> was an English actor. He was best known for his role in the television drama series Lovejoy. There was a boys' boarding school in Lifton Park, which was where <mask> was educated. He was kicked out of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for responding to rock-and-roll after serving in the Royal Air Force. After early stage work with Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, <mask> became known for his unusual roles in two films directed by Sidney J. Furie. He played a teen accused of murder in The Boys and a gay biker in The Leather Boys, both of which showed his potential for offbeat screen personae. At a reunion of the three surviving stars of the earlier film in London on 17 September 2017, he said that he felt privileged that these movies had dealt with two issues close to his heart: the death penalty and gay rights.He played the title role in the original production of Mr. Sloane on stage and then went on to play the role on Broadway.

He is considered an episcopus vagans. <mask>, the archbishop of Malatya, consecrated Chechemian as a priest on November 27, 1866. Chechemian served at Besui, Aintab, and Gurum before moving to Malatya. At Malatya, Chechemian was blessed as vardapet, a highly educated celibate priest, or archimandrite, who is a doctor of theology. A vardapet may hold the same rank as a bishop, but without the power to ordain priests.While in Constantinople, Chechemian was referred to as a prominent, well known dignitary after he received his degree of very honorable doctor from Chorchorunian. There is disagreement about whether Chechemian was ever raised from vardapet to bishop. <mask> consecrated Chechemian as a bishop on April 23, 1879. According to Bain, it is doubtful that Chorchorunian ever consecrated Chechemian as a bishop.
