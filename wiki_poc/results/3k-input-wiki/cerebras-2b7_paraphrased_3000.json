Rita was their first child. <mask>'s home life was completely liberal and iconoclastic because his mother was a Christian Scientist and he was not raised within any religious traditions. The University of Pennsylvania was where Bester attended. He was a member of the fencing team and, according to his own account, was the most successful member of the team. He dropped out of Columbia Law School because he was tired of it.<mask> and Rolly Goulko were married in 1936. Rolly <mask> originated the role of Lois Lane on the radio program The Adventures of Superman. She became a vice president, casting director and supervisor at the advertising agency in New York City in the 1960s. The Besters were married for 48 years. Bester lived in Europe for a little over a year in the mid-1950s before moving to Pennsylvania with Rolly.

Bester said that two editors on the staff took an interest in him because he had just finished reading and annotating Joyce's Ulysses and would preach it enthusiastically without provocation.... If it was whipped into shape, they thought it would fill the bill. Robert A. Heinlein decided not to enter the contest as the prize was only $50 and he realized he could do better selling his 7,000-word manuscript for 70 cents a word. Heinlein told Bester that he had changed his mind about Astounding. Bester said that he replied, \"You sonofabitch.\"You beat me by twenty dollars because I won the Thrilling Wonder contest. As Bester was the winner of the contest, weisinger introduced me to the informal luncheon gatherings of the working science fiction authors of the thirties. He met a lot of people there. Weisinger published three more of Bester's stories in 1939 and 1940. Bester continued to publish short fiction after John W. Campbell's science fiction was published. <mask> was invited to contribute to various DC titles by two of his science fiction editors in 1942.

Although he has published on medical anthropology, he is best known for his engagement with Marx's idea of commodity fetishism. The American Academy in Berlin awarded him a Berlin Prize in 2007. Parents of German and Czech-Jewish descent were the parents of early life Taussig. He earned a medical degree from the University of Sydney and a PhD in anthropology from the London School of Economics after graduating from secondary education. The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South America is both a critique of anthropology and an analysis of a set of seemingly magical beliefs held by rural and urban workers. The main concern of anthropology should be to critique the Western culture.He believes that people living in the periphery of the world capitalist economy have a critical point of view on capitalism, and can articulate their critique of capitalism in terms of their own cultural idioms. He concludes that anthropologists should study peoples living in the fringes of the world capitalist economy as a way of gaining critical insight into their own culture. The anthropologists' object of study has been shifted from that of other cultures to that of their own. Critical thinkers are valued by indigenous peoples. One of the beliefs is based on both his own field research and that of June Nash, the other is based on his own research. There is a belief among semi-proletarianized peasants that proletarianized sugar-cane cutter can make a contract with the devil that will cause them to make a good deal of money, but that this money can be used for other things. According to Taussig, earlier anthropologists might have argued that this belief is a hold-over from pre-capitalist culture, or that it serves as a leveling mechanism, meaning that no individual becomes significantly wealthier than any of his or her fellows.When capitalism breeds poverty, disease, and death, it is because of the magic belief that capital is productive. Another example of peasants representing their own understanding of capitalism's claim that capital is productive is the second belief. Money will return to its original owner no matter how it is spent, and will bring more money back with it. The project of colonialism as it was carried out in South America is examined in the seminal work, Shamanism, Colonialism and the Wild Man: A Study in Terror and Healing. He works to create a space of all-too-real, present terror, followed by a process of healing that readers themselves are supposed to follow. In weaving literature, firsthand accounts, and his own ethnographic work, Taussig strives to create \"a mode of perception--a way of seeing through a way of talking--figuring the world through dialogue that comes alive with sudden transformative force in the crevices of everyday life's...The inscription on the edge of official history is an irregular, quavering image of hope.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.The name Abu'l-Qasim al-<mask> is also known as al-wazir al-Maghribi. After fleeing with his father to Fatimid Egypt, Abu'l-Qasim entered the bureaucracy. After his father's execution, he fled to Palestine, where he raised the local Bedouin leader to rebellion against the Fatimids. He entered the service of the Buyid emirs of Baghdad after fleeing the rebellion. He joined the service of the Uqaylids of Mosul and the Marwanids of Mayyafariqin after moving to the Jazira. He wrote a number of poems, including a \"mirror for princes\". Abu'<mask>, the grandson of the family's founder, was the son of Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn.Abu'l-Qasim's grandfather was a secretary under the ruler of the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo, who was named Sayf al-Dawla. According to the 13th-century Aleppan historian, Abu'l-Qasim was born in May   . The historian al- Maqrizi reported that he was born in Egypt, but this is incorrect. Abu'l-Qasim was forced to flee the Hamdanid domain when his father, <mask>, sided with the governor of Homs in his attempt to capture Aleppo from Sayf al-Dawla's son and heir. The Banu'l-Maghribi were forced to flee to Egypt and the \"lusher pastures of the Fatimid court\" after <mask> defected to the rebel camp. In Egypt, <mask> rose to senior posts in the caliphal administration, while Abu'l-Qasim gained an influential position in the early days of Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. The Banu'l-Maghribi was involved in the intrigues between various groups of the Fatimid court.Abu'l-Qasim was largely responsible for this turn of events according to the poet Ibn al-Qarih, who had been tutor to the Banu'l-Maghribi before the massacre. The famous Syrian poet Abu'l-Ala al-Ma'arri, who had been in contact with Abu'l-Qasim and later wrote an elegy on the latter's death, was provoked by this. Abu'l-Qasim and his family fled to Palestine in 1011. He wanted to avenge himself against the Caliph so he persuaded the Jarrahid emir to raise the Bedouins in rebellion. The revolt spread quickly through the hinterland. The coastal cities were besieged but not taken after Ramlah fell to the Bedouin. The Alid Sharif of Mecca, Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far, was proclaimed in July 1012 by Abu'l-Qasim.Abu'l-Futuh abandoned the revolt and returned to Mecca because he was dismayed by the lack of respect shown to him by the Jarrahids. In Iraq, Abu'l- Qasim tried to flee under Buyid control. The Abbasid caliph, al-Qadir, was initially suspicious of Abu'l- Qasim's intentions due to his nisbah. Before entering the court of Nasr al-Dawla ibn Ahmad, the Marwanid ruler of Mayy, he switched to the service of the Uqaylid ruler of Mosul, Qirwash ibn al-Mukhallad.

At the outbreak of World War I, he took a Nazirite vow. The scion of a distinguished rabbinic family, <mask> was born in Maiiagala, near Vilna. He studied at the yeshiva in Slabodka, as well as at the Volozhin yeshiva. He extended his studies beyond the traditional subjects taught in the yeshivot because of his restless and inquiring mind. Rabbi Kook's early writings were turned to by him. He studied Russian in order to get into the university.He was not arrested during the Russian Revolution. His spiritual unrest and desire to widen his intellectual horizon led him to enroll in the Academy for Jewish Studies established by Baron <mask>, where one of his close fellow students was Zalman Shazar, later president of Israel. He went to Germany to study at the University of Freiburg. At the outbreak of World War I, he was an enemy alien who was released and went to Switzerland, where he became involved in the Jewish Community and studied philosophy, classical literature, and Roman law. He lectured on Jewish philosophy as chairman of the Jewish Students' Society there. He took a lifelong Nazirite vow, which involves complete abstention from cutting one's hair and taking any products of the vine. His personal asceticism went further, as he became vegetarian, refrained from meat but also any garment made of leather, and practiced self-imposed silence vows on a regular basis.An annual silence period of 41 days from Erev Rosh Hodesh Elul to the end of Yom Kippur is the highlight. Despite being proficient in a number of languages, he refused to speak Hebrew. After the capture of the Old City of Jerusalem by the Jordanians in 1947\u20131949 Palestine war, he vowed not to leave his home. After Israel's independence in 1948, he promised not to leave the Holy City of Jerusalem and left only 3 times, with each departure approved by a special Rabbinical Court. He was warm, welcoming and respectful towards any person who came to see him, regardless of their status, age, or eccentricities. Rabbi <mask> was fully aware of the day-to-day occurrences in Israel and did not hesitate to publicly express his views on important issues. The turning point in his life was his meeting with Rabbi Kook.He noted that his life stood in the balance. I was turned into a new man after listening to him.... I found a master. He abandoned his secular studies and devoted himself to Jewish thought. He was invited to become a tutor in the yeshiva by Rabbi Kook, who had returned to the Land of Israel. The curriculum was to include history, philosophy, ethics, Hebrew grammar, and Bible.He was a lecturer in ethics and philosophy. Rabbi Kook gave him the editing of his works to which he dedicated his life, although he left over 30 works in manuscript.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.<mask> is an American journalist, author and feminist activist best known for her 1975 book Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape. According to Brownmiller, rape used to be defined by men rather than women, and that men use it as a way of keeping women in a state of fear. Against Our Will was selected as one of the most important books of the 20th century by the New York Public Library. Mae and Samuel Warhaftig were a lower-middle-class Jewish couple. Her mother was a secretary in the Empire State Building and her father was a salesman in the Garment Center. She legally changed her name to <mask> in 1961. The Ms. campaign encouraged women to share their stories and take action after signing her name.Even though she was always a great believer in romance and partnership, she describes herself as a single woman. She told an interviewer that she was unmarried because she was not willing to compromise and that she wanted to be in close association with a man she respected. Brownmiller was sent to the East Midwood Jewish Center as a child to learn Hebrew and Jewish history. She said that a lot of people over the centuries seemed to want to harm the Jewish people.... The terror of violence against women was one of the things I learned about in Hebrew School. She attended Cornell University for two years on scholarships, but did not graduate.She studied acting in New York. She was in two off-Broadway productions. Brownmiller's path into journalism began with an editorial position. She worked as an assistant to the managing editor at Coronet, as an editor of the Albany Report, and as a national affairs researcher at Newsweek. In the 1960's, Brownmiller worked as a reporter for NBC-TV in Philadelphia, a staff writer for The Village Voice, and a network news writer for ABC-TV in New York City. Her book reviews, essays, and articles appeared in publications including The New York Times, Newsday, The New York Daily News, Vogue, and The Nation. She signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge in protest against the Vietnam War.She worked on voter registration in Mississippi when she volunteered for Freedom Summer in 1964. When no one else at the Memphis orientation session volunteered for Meridian, Jan and I accepted the assignment, according to her own account. Between us, we had a good ten years of organizing experience, hers in Democratic primaries and presidential campaigns, mine in CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, and both of us together in voter registration drives in East Harlem. A field secretary called a meeting the night we arrived, asking to see the new volunteers. We raised our hands. 'Shit!' He blew up.They sent me white women after I asked for volunteers. She became a network TV news writer at the American Broadcasting Company after returning to New York. In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution is a memoir and history of Second Wave radical feminism. Her papers are in the History of Women in America library at Harvard.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.<mask>, also known as Bill Yoerg, was an American politician, businessman, and the 32nd mayor of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Yoerg was a tire salesman and garage proprietor prior to his political career. During his time in business, he oversaw brand tires more than any other New England competitor. During his time as mayor, he oversaw the expansion of Mackenzie Stadium, the completion of the War Memorial Building, and the construction of flood controls. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor. On October 16, 1883, <mask> was born to Michael John, a mill supervisor, and Nellie Yoerg. Yoerg began working at the J. Russell & Company Hardware Store as an errand boy when he was 13 years old.He began his automotive business career at the age of 18 when he became a clerk for the Revere Tire Company on Main Street. On November 17, 1907, he married Mary G. Ware, and on April 19, 1909, he opened his own tire business. Initially across from City Hall at    , Yoerg would gradually build his business over the next three decades with the phrase \"Call Yoerg, 804\". Yoerg Tire and Rubber was settled at 158 Chestnut Street in 1915, where it remained until his retirement in 1954. He was a member of the board of directors of the Tri-County automobile club before his election. The first campaign by Yoerg against Toepfert was unsuccessful. On October 30, 1935, Yoerg took out nomination papers again.Yoerg's campaign and win in the throes of the Great Depression were reported as unexpected by the Boston Herald. Yoerg's campaign chairman labeled the mayor \"dictatorial\" for his refusal to enforce traffic orders passed by the board of alderman for new stop signs and traffic patterns. He held 10 rallies in a single day to criticize the incumbent administration's actions as opaque and unresponsive, and appealed to many of its clubs and groups across ethnic and class lines. Yoerg was able to win over voters by portraying his opponent as autocratic, chastising Toepfert's hold over the welfare commission, and appealing to his experience in the automotive industry. On December 3, 1935, he won an electoral upset by a margin of 1,203 votes. Yoerg met with President Franklin Roosevelt in Springfield on August 1, 1936, on behalf of the mayors and selectmen of Western Massachusetts. He was credited with successfully lobbying for over a million dollars in Works Progress Administration funds for several streets and sewer projects.In 1939 Yoerg spent a series of radio broadcasts outlining the housing, infrastructure, and other issues that needed to be addressed by the city and its counterparts in state and Federal government. The beginning of the first 2-year term in the city's history was marked by Yoerg's victories in 1936 and 1937. Yoerg dropped out of the race to lead the Housing Authority in October 1939, just two months before the election. When he resigned as executive director of the agency in September 1940, he would return to managing his garage full time.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.The Belgian opera singer <mask>nos at the Paris Op\u00e9ra from 1860 to 1870. She created the roles of S\u00e9lika in the world premiere of Meyerbeer's L'Africaine and Elisabeth de Valois in the world premiere of Verdi's Don Carlos. She studied music in Milan with Franois-Auguste Gevaert, and made her debut in Venice as Gilda in Verdi. She began her career as a vocalist in the caf\u00e9s of Paris and Brussels after the death of her father. Delphine Ugalde heard her at the Caf\u00e9 G\u00e9ant in Paris. The director of the Th\u00e9tre Lyrique at that time was L\u00e9on Carvalho, who was brought to the attention of Ugalde by her singing lessons.On September 27, 1859, <mask> performed in Mozart's Les noces de Figaro using the stage name <mask>x. One reviewer wrote, \"Mlle Sax possesses a magnificent voice, but both as a vocalist and as an actress, she is in the state of raw material, which will undoubtedly reward the discoverer.\"... Mlle Sax's talents were discovered at an early stage as her voice is still fresh, and she has not been long enough in the exercise of her calling to form any vicious habits. Her present school and her time and experience will make her a valuable acquisition to the stage. She performed as Eurydice in Gluck's Orph\u00e9e after her initial success at the Th\u00e9tre Lyrique. The version of the opera which was used in this landmark revival was prepared by the composer, who also coached and supervised the singers.The opera was originally written in Italian as Orfeo ed Euridice and was performed by Gaetano Guadagni. When Gluck decided to bring the opera to Paris in 1774, castrato singers were unusual in France and sometimes objects of ridicule. Gluck adapted the role of Orph\u00e9e for the haute-contre Joseph Legros. The opera was rarely performed because the French version was impractical due to the rise in standard pitch. The Spanish opera singer was suggested to sing the role by Giacomo Meyerbeer. He wanted her to perform the opera in his theatre because he had heard it in a concert. The new adaptation was to be prepared by an expert on the music of Gluck.When he heard that Carvalho was casting Mademoiselle Sax, a singer, as described by him, he suggested that he had good intentions. She had a beautiful voice without art, but Berlioz thought she was ignorant as a carp of everything to do with art. At one of the rehearsals, she asked Viardot if he was Monsieur Gluck, and she became famous for it. It's one of his friends. In his absence, he has a nerve. Gluck had already been dead for 72 years. The performances, which began on 18 November 1859, were enormously successful, both critically and commercially, and were attended by many of the important musicians in Paris.Between 1859 and 1863, the production received 136 representations. The role of Mlle Sax in the show proved to be the beginning of her rise to fame, as she was the star of the show. Bacchante in Gounod's Philmon et Baucis was the final season at the Th\u00e9tre Lyrique.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.The islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Kerguelen, and Vanuatu were the focus of the work of the French explorer and photographer, <mask> de <mask> Rue is named after him. On 7 October 1901, <mask> was born in Switzerland and died on 24 February 1991 in Lausanne. He was an engineer-geologist from the University of Nancy and a scientific adviser for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. He received a Doctor of Natural Science from the University of Paris. He spent time in the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Kerguelen, and Vanuatu. As an Associate of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, he was involved in geological activities that led to difficult surveys all around the French Union.On December 7, 1951, <mask> <mask> Re was elected as a corresponding member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences d'outre-mer. He taught higher studies of Latin America from 1966 to 1967. The Kerguelen Archipelago: 12 November 1928 to 25 February 1929, 25 January to 27 March 1931, 11 December 1949 to 16 January 1950, 12 December 1951 to 6 January 1953. He has traveled with his wife on many other journeys. There were six journeys to the Kerguelen Islands made by <mask> <mask> Rue. He spent more than two years in the islands with his wife.

Kallenbach designed a house for them to live in.Gandhi received a thousand-acre farm from a rich man in 1910. The farm was used to house the families of satyagrahis. The farm was named after the author as he was influenced by his writings. <mask> abandoned the life of a wealthy, sport-loving bachelor and adopted a vegetarian diet and politics of Gandhi on this farm. A close friend and follower of Gandhi was Henry Polak. During the Satyagraha struggle, <mask> was associated with Gandhi.

Gandhi was visited by <mask> in May 1937 to garner his sympathy and support for Zionism. The architect was involved in all the activities of Gandhi's life. I join the whole programme.... It is almost like the old joint life, with all the events that affected millions of people gone.

He was forced to pay homage to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia two years before he ruled with his brothers. He was appointed Governor of Gdask Pomerania after paying homage to his uncle Wadysaw I.He was forced to abandon his post as a result of the invasion of the Teutonic Order, even though he was asked to return the cities taken by the Teutonic Knights to their rightful owner. <mask> <mask> and his brother Przemys were involved in a financial dispute. Both princes were excommunicated by the Bishop on January 2, 1311 after they stole the district of Raci. The princes imprisoned the Bishop and his brother. The excommunication against the princes was lifted after the Bishop and his brother were released.

The Culture Project in New York City received the American premiere of the play in 2006. The play was praised by Karen J. Greenberg, who is the Executive Director of the Center on Law and Security at the NYU School of Law. A book of essays entitled \"One of the Guys: Women as Aggressors and Torturers\" was edited by Tara McKelvey and has a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. \"Who, really, are the victimizers?\" is the conclusion of Greenberg's essay....The answer is complex, but would come to light with some clarity in an independent investigation or Congressional inquiry.

One of the important expressions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly in California was the high temperatures between 1000 and 1350 A.D. <mask> and Professor Lloyd documented 1000 years of changes in treeline in the Sierra Nevada, noting that the response of high-elevation tree lines to global warming will depend on the water supply.She and Professor Andy Bunn from Western Washington University were able to refine the role of topography in regulating temperature-growth relationships in high elevation forests.

As the younger brother of Brian and <mask>, he was the group's defacto leader in the early 1970s. He was the band's musical director until his death. Influenced by the guitar playing of Chuck Berry and the Ventures, <mask>'s initial role in the group was that of lead guitarist and backing vocals, but he later performed lead vocals on several of their later hits. He played with the studio musicians employed during the group's critical and commercial peak in the mid 1960s. <mask> produced the majority of the group's albums between 1969 and 1973. He spent several years challenging his draft status as a conscientious objector.<mask> tried to launch a solo career in the 1980's, releasing two albums. The posthumous album Like a Brother was recorded in the 1990s with Robert Lamm and Gerry Beckley. He was a member of the Beach Boys when they were in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <mask> was a member of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness. He died of lung cancer in 1998. <mask> <mask> was the youngest of the three <mask> boys and was born in Hawthorne, California. He practiced harmony vocals under the guidance of his brother Brian, who often sang in the family music room with his mother and brothers.<mask> asked his parents to buy him a guitar at the age of 12 because he was inspired by a country star.
