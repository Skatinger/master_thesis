{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\nThe name Abu'l-Qasim al-<mask> is also known as al-wazir al-Maghribi. After fleeing with his father to Fatimid Egypt, Abu'l-Qasim entered the bureaucracy. After his father's execution, he fled to Palestine, where he raised the local Bedouin leader to rebellion against the Fatimids. He entered the service of the Buyid emirs of Baghdad after fleeing the rebellion. He joined the service of the Uqaylids of Mosul and the Marwanids of Mayyafariqin after moving to the Jazira. He wrote a number of poems, including a \"mirror for princes\". Abu'<mask>, the grandson of the family's founder, was the son of Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn.Abu'l-Qasim's grandfather was a secretary under the ruler of the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo, who was named Sayf al-Dawla. According to the 13th-century Aleppan historian, Abu'l-Qasim was born in May   . The historian al- Maqrizi reported that he was born in Egypt, but this is incorrect. Abu'l-Qasim was forced to flee the Hamdanid domain when his father, <mask>, sided with the governor of Homs in his attempt to capture Aleppo from Sayf al-Dawla's son and heir. The Banu'l-Maghribi were forced to flee to Egypt and the \"lusher pastures of the Fatimid court\" after <mask> defected to the rebel camp. In Egypt, <mask> rose to senior posts in the caliphal administration, while Abu'l-Qasim gained an influential position in the early days of Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. The Banu'l-Maghribi was involved in the intrigues between various groups of the Fatimid court.Abu'l-Qasim was largely responsible for this turn of events according to the poet Ibn al-Qarih, who had been tutor to the Banu'l-Maghribi before the massacre. The famous Syrian poet Abu'l-Ala al-Ma'arri, who had been in contact with Abu'l-Qasim and later wrote an elegy on the latter's death, was provoked by this. Abu'l-Qasim and his family fled to Palestine in 1011. He wanted to avenge himself against the Caliph so he persuaded the Jarrahid emir to raise the Bedouins in rebellion. The revolt spread quickly through the hinterland. The coastal cities were besieged but not taken after Ramlah fell to the Bedouin. The Alid Sharif of Mecca, Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far, was proclaimed in July 1012 by Abu'l-Qasim.Abu'l-Futuh abandoned the revolt and returned to Mecca because he was dismayed by the lack of respect shown to him by the Jarrahids. In Iraq, Abu'l- Qasim tried to flee under Buyid control. The Abbasid caliph, al-Qadir, was initially suspicious of Abu'l- Qasim's intentions due to his nisbah. Before entering the court of Nasr al-Dawla ibn Ahmad, the Marwanid ruler of Mayy, he switched to the service of the Uqaylid ruler of Mosul, Qirwash ibn al-Mukhallad.

He studied at the yeshiva in Slabodka, as well as at the Volozhin yeshiva. He extended his studies beyond the traditional subjects taught in the yeshivot because of his restless and inquiring mind. Rabbi Kook's early writings were turned to by him. He studied Russian in order to get into the university.He was not arrested during the Russian Revolution. His spiritual unrest and desire to widen his intellectual horizon led him to enroll in the Academy for Jewish Studies established by Baron <mask>, where one of his close fellow students was Zalman Shazar, later president of Israel. He went to Germany to study at the University of Freiburg. At the outbreak of World War I, he was an enemy alien who was released and went to Switzerland, where he became involved in the Jewish Community and studied philosophy, classical literature, and Roman law. He lectured on Jewish philosophy as chairman of the Jewish Students' Society there. He took a lifelong Nazirite vow, which involves complete abstention from cutting one's hair and taking any products of the vine. His personal asceticism went further, as he became vegetarian, refrained from meat but also any garment made of leather, and practiced self-imposed silence vows on a regular basis.An annual silence period of 41 days from Erev Rosh Hodesh Elul to the end of Yom Kippur is the highlight. Despite being proficient in a number of languages, he refused to speak Hebrew. After the capture of the Old City of Jerusalem by the Jordanians in 1947\u20131949 Palestine war, he vowed not to leave his home.

At the outbreak of World War I, he took a Nazirite vow. The scion of a distinguished rabbinic family, <mask> was born in Maiiagala, near Vilna. He studied at the yeshiva in Slabodka, as well as at the Volozhin yeshiva. He extended his studies beyond the traditional subjects taught in the yeshivot because of his restless and inquiring mind. Rabbi Kook's early writings were turned to by him. He studied Russian in order to get into the university.He was not arrested during the Russian Revolution. His spiritual unrest and desire to widen his intellectual horizon led him to enroll in the Academy for Jewish Studies established by Baron <mask>, where one of his close fellow students was Zalman Shazar, later president of Israel. He went to Germany to study at the University of Freiburg. At the outbreak of World War I, he was an enemy alien who was released and went to Switzerland, where he became involved in the Jewish Community and studied philosophy, classical literature, and Roman law. He lectured on Jewish philosophy as chairman of the Jewish Students' Society there. He took a lifelong Nazirite vow, which involves complete abstention from cutting one's hair and taking any products of the vine. His personal asceticism went further, as he became vegetarian, refrained from meat but also any garment made of leather, and practiced self-imposed silence vows on a regular basis.An annual silence period of 41 days from Erev Rosh Hodesh Elul to the end of Yom Kippur is the highlight. Despite being proficient in a number of languages, he refused to speak Hebrew. After the capture of the Old City of Jerusalem by the Jordanians in 1947\u20131949 Palestine war, he vowed not to leave his home. After Israel's independence in 1948, he promised not to leave the Holy City of Jerusalem and left only 3 times, with each departure approved by a special Rabbinical Court. He was warm, welcoming and respectful towards any person who came to see him, regardless of their status, age, or eccentricities. Rabbi <mask> was fully aware of the day-to-day occurrences in Israel and did not hesitate to publicly express his views on important issues. The turning point in his life was his meeting with Rabbi Kook.He noted that his life stood in the balance. I was turned into a new man after listening to him.... I found a master. He abandoned his secular studies and devoted himself to Jewish thought. He was invited to become a tutor in the yeshiva by Rabbi Kook, who had returned to the Land of Israel.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> is an American journalist, author and feminist activist best known for her 1975 book Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape. According to Brownmiller, rape used to be defined by men rather than women, and that men use it as a way of keeping women in a state of fear. Against Our Will was selected as one of the most important books of the 20th century by the New York Public Library. Mae and Samuel Warhaftig were a lower-middle-class Jewish couple. Her mother was a secretary in the Empire State Building and her father was a salesman in the Garment Center. She legally changed her name to <mask> in 1961. The Ms. campaign encouraged women to share their stories and take action after signing her name.Even though she was always a great believer in romance and partnership, she describes herself as a single woman.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask>, also known as Bill Yoerg, was an American politician, businessman, and the 32nd mayor of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Yoerg was a tire salesman and garage proprietor prior to his political career. During his time in business, he oversaw brand tires more than any other New England competitor. During his time as mayor, he oversaw the expansion of Mackenzie Stadium, the completion of the War Memorial Building, and the construction of flood controls. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor. On October 16, 1883, <mask> was born to Michael John, a mill supervisor, and Nellie Yoerg. Yoerg began working at the J. Russell & Company Hardware Store as an errand boy when he was 13 years old.He began his automotive business career at the age of 18 when he became a clerk for the Revere Tire Company on Main Street. On November 17, 1907, he married Mary G. Ware, and on April 19, 1909, he opened his own tire business. Initially across from City Hall at    , Yoerg would gradually build his business over the next three decades with the phrase \"Call Yoerg, 804\". Yoerg Tire and Rubber was settled at 158 Chestnut Street in 1915, where it remained until his retirement in 1954. He was a member of the board of directors of the Tri-County automobile club before his election. The first campaign by Yoerg against Toepfert was unsuccessful. On October 30, 1935, Yoerg took out nomination papers again.Yoerg's campaign and win in the throes of the Great Depression were reported as unexpected by the Boston Herald. Yoerg's campaign chairman labeled the mayor \"dictatorial\" for his refusal to enforce traffic orders passed by the board of alderman for new stop signs and traffic patterns. He held 10 rallies in a single day to criticize the incumbent administration's actions as opaque and unresponsive, and appealed to many of its clubs and groups across ethnic and class lines. Yoerg was able to win over voters by portraying his opponent as autocratic, chastising Toepfert's hold over the welfare commission, and appealing to his experience in the automotive industry. On December 3, 1935, he won an electoral upset by a margin of 1,203 votes. Yoerg met with President Franklin Roosevelt in Springfield on August 1, 1936, on behalf of the mayors and selectmen of Western Massachusetts. He was credited with successfully lobbying for over a million dollars in Works Progress Administration funds for several streets and sewer projects.In 1939 Yoerg spent a series of radio broadcasts outlining the housing, infrastructure, and other issues that needed to be addressed by the city and its counterparts in state and Federal government. The beginning of the first 2-year term in the city's history was marked by Yoerg's victories in 1936 and 1937. Yoerg dropped out of the race to lead the Housing Authority in October 1939, just two months before the election. When he resigned as executive director of the agency in September 1940, he would return to managing his garage full time.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\nThe Belgian opera singer <mask>nos at the Paris Op\u00e9ra from 1860 to 1870. She created the roles of S\u00e9lika in the world premiere of Meyerbeer's L'Africaine and Elisabeth de Valois in the world premiere of Verdi's Don Carlos. She studied music in Milan with Franois-Auguste Gevaert, and made her debut in Venice as Gilda in Verdi. She began her career as a vocalist in the caf\u00e9s of Paris and Brussels after the death of her father. Delphine Ugalde heard her at the Caf\u00e9 G\u00e9ant in Paris. The director of the Th\u00e9tre Lyrique at that time was L\u00e9on Carvalho, who was brought to the attention of Ugalde by her singing lessons.On September 27, 1859, <mask> performed in Mozart's Les noces de Figaro using the stage name <mask>x. One reviewer wrote, \"Mlle Sax possesses a magnificent voice, but both as a vocalist and as an actress, she is in the state of raw material, which will undoubtedly reward the discoverer.\"... Mlle Sax's talents were discovered at an early stage as her voice is still fresh, and she has not been long enough in the exercise of her calling to form any vicious habits. Her present school and her time and experience will make her a valuable acquisition to the stage. She performed as Eurydice in Gluck's Orph\u00e9e after her initial success at the Th\u00e9tre Lyrique. The version of the opera which was used in this landmark revival was prepared by the composer, who also coached and supervised the singers.The opera was originally written in Italian as Orfeo ed Euridice and was performed by Gaetano Guadagni. When Gluck decided to bring the opera to Paris in 1774, castrato singers were unusual in France and sometimes objects of ridicule. Gluck adapted the role of Orph\u00e9e for the haute-contre Joseph Legros. The opera was rarely performed because the French version was impractical due to the rise in standard pitch. The Spanish opera singer was suggested to sing the role by Giacomo Meyerbeer. He wanted her to perform the opera in his theatre because he had heard it in a concert. The new adaptation was to be prepared by an expert on the music of Gluck.When he heard that Carvalho was casting Mademoiselle Sax, a singer, as described by him, he suggested that he had good intentions. She had a beautiful voice without art, but Berlioz thought she was ignorant as a carp of everything to do with art. At one of the rehearsals, she asked Viardot if he was Monsieur Gluck, and she became famous for it. It's one of his friends. In his absence, he has a nerve. Gluck had already been dead for 72 years. The performances, which began on 18 November 1859, were enormously successful, both critically and commercially, and were attended by many of the important musicians in Paris.Between 1859 and 1863, the production received 136 representations. The role of Mlle Sax in the show proved to be the beginning of her rise to fame, as she was the star of the show.

His paintings in the Bloodline series are mostly portraits of Chinese people with large, dark-pupiled eyes, posed in a stiff manner reminiscent of family portraits from the 1950s and 1960s. For the first time, he created sculptures that were three dimensions in comparison to his \"Bloodlines\" portrait series. These sculptures have been featured in many exhibits and continue his work as one of China's leading, and most highly sought-after, contemporary artists. He was the third of four brothers to be born to parents who were both government officials in the city of Kunming in China's Yunnan province. <mask>'s mother taught him how to draw as an exercise to keep him out of trouble. We were given paper and crayons to draw at home.I became more interested in art. I didn't have to go to school. My interest went up. I didn't give up on art after I became an adult. That's how I started to draw. The Chinese government took his parents away for 3 years. The Cultural Revolution, which took place in the 1960s and 1970s, influenced his painting.Xiaogang was sent to work on a farm in 1976, as part of the \"Down to the Countryside Movement\".

Xiaogang was accepted into the Sichuan Academy of Fine arts in 1977 after the reinstitution of collegiate entrance exams.At the time of his collegiate education, his professors continued to teach styles of Revolutionary Realism that were instituted by Chairman Mao. This encouraged Xiaogang and his peers to focus on western philosophy and individualism while avoiding political and ideological topics. He was denied a teaching post after graduating from the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts in 1982. Between 1982 and 1985 there was a period of depression. He was an art director and a construction worker for a social dance troupe. Xiaogang had difficulties fitting into society and it was a time of intense self-examination. He was hospitalized in 1984 with alcohol-caused internal bleeding which caused him to paint \"The Ghost Between Black and White\" series which was a depiction of his visions of life and death in the hospital.The private feelings I had at the hospital inspired my inspiration. Many ghost-like patients were comforting each other in the crammed hospital wards when I lay on the white bed sheet. groaning sounds rose above the hospital and some of the withering bodies around had gone to waste and were drifting on the verge of death: these deeply stirred my feelings. They were very close to my life experiences. Xiaogang joined the New Wave movement in China in 1985 after he emerged from a dark time in his life.

He was a prince member of the <mask>ast, Duke of Inowrocaw from 1287-1314 under his mother and brother. He was the son of Inowrocaw and Salomea, daughter of Sambor II, Duke of Pomerelia. After the death of their father in 1287, <mask>, his older brothers Leszek and Przemys, and their paternal half-uncle Wadysaw I the Elbow remained under the control of their mother and paternal half-uncle. <mask> III had a majority. He was forced to pay homage to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia two years before he ruled with his brothers. He was appointed Governor of Gdask Pomerania after paying homage to his uncle Wadysaw I.He was forced to abandon his post as a result of the invasion of the Teutonic Order, even though he was asked to return the cities taken by the Teutonic Knights to their rightful owner. <mask> <mask> and his brother Przemys were involved in a financial dispute. Both princes were excommunicated by the Bishop on January 2, 1311 after they stole the district of Raci. The princes imprisoned the Bishop and his brother. The excommunication against the princes was lifted after the Bishop and his brother were released. The division of the paternal inheritance took place in 1314 and Kazimi III received the small district of Gniewkowo as the youngest son. He took part in a meeting in June of 1318.His name appears on a document dated from 1325 on the occasion of the conclusion of an alliance between Wadysaw I and Western Pomerania. During the next stage of the Polish-Teutonic War, the Teutonic Knights besieged Gniewkowo. After burning the main fortress, <mask> <mask> decided to escape. During the war, all Kujawy was lost, and <mask> was in exile. His fate after the loss of his domain is uncertain because he only appeared during the Second Polish-Teutonic Trial and the Treaty of Kalisz. <mask> <mask> died between August and May. Is it known where he was buried?The name and origins of <mask> III's wife are unknown. He was already a widower when he came back to Gniewkowo. According to the chronicler Jan of Czarnkw, <mask> III had several sons and daughters, but only two survive to adulthood.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> is a critic of Indian art, theatre and film. His father was a professor of English literature at the University of Edinburgh. Subrata, the oldest of <mask>'s sons, joined the Communist Party because his political consciousness inspired the younger <mask> to study English literature. After graduating from the University of Calcutta in 1961, <mask> earned a Master of Arts degree in English literature. He was a lecturer at Rabindra Bharati University. He worked at the Oxford University Press until 1982. He quit because he couldn't afford to buy the books he wanted to read.He took up tutoring English literature because it enriched his reading as well as brushed his critical edge. He worked with Seagull Books and Thema Publishing. After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Bandyopadhyay became a member of the Communist Party of India. Gramscian thought was incorporated in Indian Marxism. His book was published in Calcutta in 1993. His first writing on theatre was on an actor from Beijing opera. The Jatra performances he saw in 1962 were the subject of his next article.He started interviewing contemporary stalwarts of Bangla theatre, such as Utpal Dutt and Badal Sircar, for further clarifications on their works. When we have a production of The Threepenny Opera which simply goes in for wild fun, we regard it as a betrayal. There is serious political violence in Calcutta.... Status quo theatre doesn't mean anything to a generation that thinks in political terms. Foucault's influence on him seems to be a later development. In 1986, he says that power is defined horizontally in the play Ghashiram Kotwal, which is a reference to Maurice Duverger's The Idea of Politics, London, 1966.He doesn't have a discourse of power yet. In his 2003 introduction to a collection of Tendulkar's plays, he sees them evolving around the hub of ethical concern exploring and critiquing the relations of power in all their complex ramifications. Bandyopadhyay wrote in 1983 that the film raised \"disturbing questions about the Indian reality today and about the capacity of the medium to tackle this reality.\" <mask> has been questioning the film's capacity. His assessment is that Bangla theatre or film did not enter into the social-political complexities of the 1970s. The emblemized angry young man of Kolkata was only able to relate to his rural other on the basis of Marxian theory. The urban youth is portrayed as either hiding or being attacked, not directly participating in revolutionary activities.The general portrait of the angry young man is seen in theatre and films. He told a story about book editing to Anandabazar Patrika. In 1986 there was a bibliography. There is an introduction. In the movie Ghashiram Kotwal. Calcutta. Seagull books.1994.

After graduating from the University of Calcutta in 1961, <mask> earned a Master of Arts degree in English literature. He was a lecturer at Rabindra Bharati University. He worked at the Oxford University Press until 1982. He quit because he couldn't afford to buy the books he wanted to read.He took up tutoring English literature because it enriched his reading as well as brushed his critical edge. He worked with Seagull Books and Thema Publishing. After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Bandyopadhyay became a member of the Communist Party of India. Gramscian thought was incorporated in Indian Marxism. His book was published in Calcutta in 1993. His first writing on theatre was on an actor from Beijing opera. The Jatra performances he saw in 1962 were the subject of his next article.He started interviewing contemporary stalwarts of Bangla theatre, such as Utpal Dutt and Badal Sircar, for further clarifications on their works. When we have a production of The Threepenny Opera which simply goes in for wild fun, we regard it as a betrayal. There is serious political violence in Calcutta.... Status quo theatre doesn't mean anything to a generation that thinks in political terms. Foucault's influence on him seems to be a later development. In 1986, he says that power is defined horizontally in the play Ghashiram Kotwal, which is a reference to Maurice Duverger's The Idea of Politics, London, 1966.He doesn't have a discourse of power yet. In his 2003 introduction to a collection of Tendulkar's plays, he sees them evolving around the hub of ethical concern exploring and critiquing the relations of power in all their complex ramifications. Bandyopadhyay wrote in 1983 that the film raised \"disturbing questions about the Indian reality today and about the capacity of the medium to tackle this reality.\" <mask> has been questioning the film's capacity. His assessment is that Bangla theatre or film did not enter into the social-political complexities of the 1970s. The emblemized angry young man of Kolkata was only able to relate to his rural other on the basis of Marxian theory.

A book of essays entitled \"One of the Guys: Women as Aggressors and Torturers\" was edited by Tara McKelvey and has a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. \"Who, really, are the victimizers?\" is the conclusion of Greenberg's essay....The answer is complex, but would come to light with some clarity in an independent investigation or Congressional inquiry.

He was the manager of the San Francisco office of the Thames & Mersey Marine Insurance company from 1879 to 1879. The name of the company's office was \"Messrs. Cross & Co\".

He was a member of the Beach Boys when they were in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <mask> was a member of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness.

{"prediction_0":"The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\nThe Battle Force of the United States Fleet was commanded by a four-star admiral named <mask> from 1934 to 1935. He was appointed from the state of Georgia to the United States Naval Academy in the early 19th century. He was commissioned ensign on July 1, 1897, after serving two years of sea duty as a passed midshipman. He was a junior officer aboard the armored cruiser New York at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba and later served in the Philippine Insurrection. He served as navigator on the New Hampshire during a one-week visit to Russia in May 1911. The wardroom was invited to dinner by Nicholas II. The battleships Louisiana, Kansas, New Hampshire, and the first of the dreadnought battleships South Carolina were part of the visit.Shortly before the United States' entry into World War I, he was promoted to the temporary rank of captain, and his first command was the protected cruiser Cincinnati. After the war, he commanded the battleship Kansas from 1920 to 1921 and the battleship New Mexico from 1924 to 1926, before being promoted to rear admiral and assigned as commander Control Force, United States Fleet and commander Submarine Divisions, Control Force. On December 17, 1927, the Control Force submarine S-4 was accidentally rammed and sank by the United States Coast Guard destroyer Paulding. Captain Ernest J. assisted in the rescue effort. King commanded the salvage operation for the sunken submarine. As the weather worsened, the minesweeper tried to attach air hoses to the sunken submarine to get it to the surface, but to no avail. The winter storm lasted for days, and finally, the order was given for Falcon to ride out the storm in the harbor.The crewmen died of suffocation. Newspaper reporters went to Provincetown to cover the disaster. Some of the letters and telegrams were so abusive that King advised him to ignore them. \"Why, King, if I had known it was that son-of-a-bitch, I wouldn't have shook hands with him either,\" said <mask> after learning of King's snub. The Navy convened a court of inquiry to investigate the sinking and failed rescue operation. \"I just can't be positive about such things,\" he said under questioning.

I can't answer that question. The divers did all they could. I can't tell you the details.You will have to ask the technical men.
