Early life.', 'Theodore Robert Bundy was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped, and murdered numerous young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier. He admitted to committing 30 homicides in seven states between 1974 and 1978. His true victim total could be much higher. He was seen as handsome and charismatic, qualities that he used to win the trust of victims and society. He would approach his victims in public places, pretending to be injured or disabled, and then take them to secondary locations to rape and kill them. He would sometimes revisit his victims and perform sexual acts with their decomposing corpses until they were destroyed by wild animals. He kept some of the severed heads in his apartment. He attacked his victims as they slept on a few occasions. In 1975, he was jailed in Utah for kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He was a suspect in a long list of unsolved homicides. Facing murder charges in Colorado, he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults in Florida, including three murders. He was sentenced to death for three Florida homicides. On January 24, 1989 he was executed at Florida State Prison. He was described as a "sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human\'s pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death, and even after." He said he was the most cold-hearted son of a bitch. Attorney Polly Nelson is a member of his last defense team. She wrote that <mask> was the definition of "heartless evil". Early life.']
