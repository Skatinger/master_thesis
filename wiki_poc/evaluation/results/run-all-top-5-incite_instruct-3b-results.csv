He was an illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI and member of the Spanish-Aragonese House of Borgia. After initially entering the church and becoming a cardinal on his father's election to the Papacy, he became, after the death of his brother in 1498, the first person to resign a. He served as a condottiero for King Louis XII of France around 1500, and occupied Milan and Naples during the Italian Wars.
