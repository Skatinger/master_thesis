He was an editor of the newspaper and magazine "Bezbozhnik" and a member of the bureau of the district party committee. There were disagreements with representatives of the clergy in the 1920s.

After the retirement of his father, <mask>, he became shogun at the age of 45.After Ienari's death in 1841, Senior Rj Mizuno Tadakuni was able to purge the government of his cronies, and implement measures to reform the shogunate's finances. The Tenp Reforms attempt to stabilizing the economy by banning most forms of entertainment and displays of wealth, which were characteristic of the early Edo period. The restrictions were unpopular with the commoners. Increasing criticism of the government's handling of foreign affairs led to the Bansha no goku. Tokugawa control over the strategically vital areas of Edo and saka was consolidated when the Agechi-rei of 1843 surrendered their holdings for equal amounts of land elsewhere. This was unpopular with all ranks and income levels. In May 1844, Edo Castle burned down, and Mizuno Tadakuni was forced into exile.Tsutsui Masanori was one of the new rj. He forced the retirement of <mask> in 1844 and placed his seventh son, <mask>u, as head of the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa house in 1847. The retirement of Shimazu Narioki was forced by him.

His film credits include Made of Honor, Sixty Six, Blackadder: Back & Forth, Roseanna\'s Grave, City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly\'s Gold, and Leonard Part 6.

Walkers crisps was the subject of a series of television commercials. Gary Lineker and Victoria Beckham are two of the celebrities featured in the commercials. A friend told me that the commercials have become like little Woody Allen films because people want to appear in them. Even though he didn\'t need the money, Lewis wanted to be more accessible to the British public. David Seaman and Victoria Beckham did a good job. The owner of The Paul Weiland Film Company is a multimillionaire due to his work on television commercials.His company won the top British TV Awards prize for five years in a row. Leonard Part 6 was a comedy starring Bill Cosby as a secret agent who is called out of retirement to save the world from an evil genius who has developed the ability to brainwash small animals into killing humans. The film was a flop. The Village Voice said it was the worst film of the decade. The Los Angeles Times wrote about "Leonard Part 6". There is virtually nothing to laugh at in this film. Cosby, as star, producer and idea man, is clearly the auteur here.His direction of Leonard Part 6 resulted in him being nominated for a Worst Director award.

After fleeing with his father to Fatimid Egypt, Abu\'l-Qasim entered the bureaucracy. After his father\'s execution, he fled to Palestine, where he raised the local Bedouin leader to rebellion against the Fatimids. He entered the service of the Buyid emirs of Baghdad after fleeing the rebellion. He joined the service of the Uqaylids of Mosul and the Marwanids of Mayyafariqin after moving to the Jazira. He wrote a number of poems, including a "mirror for princes". Abu\'<mask>, the grandson of the family\'s founder, was the son of Abu\'l-Qasim al-Husayn.Abu\'l-Qasim\'s grandfather was a secretary under the ruler of the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo, who was named Sayf al-Dawla. According to the 13th-century Aleppan historian, Abu\'l-Qasim was born in May   . The historian al- Maqrizi reported that he was born in Egypt, but this is incorrect. Abu\'l-Qasim was forced to flee the Hamdanid domain when his father, <mask>, sided with the governor of Homs in his attempt to capture Aleppo from Sayf al-Dawla\'s son and heir. The Banu\'l-Maghribi were forced to flee to Egypt and the "lusher pastures of the Fatimid court" after <mask> defected to the rebel camp. In Egypt, <mask> rose to senior posts in the caliphal administration, while Abu\'l-Qasim gained an influential position in the early days of Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. The Banu\'l-Maghribi was involved in the intrigues between various groups of the Fatimid court.Abu\'l-Qasim was largely responsible for this turn of events according to the poet Ibn al-Qarih, who had been tutor to the Banu\'l-Maghribi before the massacre. The famous Syrian poet Abu\'l-Ala al-Ma\'arri, who had been in contact with Abu\'l-Qasim and later wrote an elegy on the latter\'s death, was provoked by this. Abu\'l-Qasim and his family fled to Palestine in 1011. He wanted to avenge himself against the Caliph so he persuaded the Jarrahid emir to raise the Bedouins in rebellion.

According to Brownmiller, rape used to be defined by men rather than women, and that men use it as a way of keeping women in a state of fear. Against Our Will was selected as one of the most important books of the 20th century by the New York Public Library. Mae and Samuel Warhaftig were a lower-middle-class Jewish couple. Her mother was a secretary in the Empire State Building and her father was a salesman in the Garment Center. She legally changed her name to <mask> in 1961. The Ms. campaign encouraged women to share their stories and take action after signing her name.Even though she was always a great believer in romance and partnership, she describes herself as a single woman. She told an interviewer that she was unmarried because she was not willing to compromise and that she wanted to be in close association with a man she respected. Brownmiller was sent to the East Midwood Jewish Center as a child to learn Hebrew and Jewish history. She said that a lot of people over the centuries seemed to want to harm the Jewish people.... The terror of violence against women was one of the things I learned about in Hebrew School. She attended Cornell University for two years on scholarships, but did not graduate.She studied acting in New York. She was in two off-Broadway productions. Brownmiller\'s path into journalism began with an editorial position. She worked as an assistant to the managing editor at Coronet, as an editor of the Albany Report, and as a national affairs researcher at Newsweek. In the 1960\'s, Brownmiller worked as a reporter for NBC-TV in Philadelphia, a staff writer for The Village Voice, and a network news writer for ABC-TV in New York City. Her book reviews, essays, and articles appeared in publications including The New York Times, Newsday, The New York Daily News, Vogue, and The Nation.

Yoerg was a tire salesman and garage proprietor prior to his political career. During his time in business, he oversaw brand tires more than any other New England competitor. During his time as mayor, he oversaw the expansion of Mackenzie Stadium, the completion of the War Memorial Building, and the construction of flood controls. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor. On October 16, 1883, <mask> was born to Michael John, a mill supervisor, and Nellie Yoerg. Yoerg began working at the J. Russell & Company Hardware Store as an errand boy when he was 13 years old.He began his automotive business career at the age of 18 when he became a clerk for the Revere Tire Company on Main Street. On November 17, 1907, he married Mary G. Ware, and on April 19, 1909, he opened his own tire business. Initially across from City Hall at    , Yoerg would gradually build his business over the next three decades with the phrase "Call Yoerg, 804". Yoerg Tire and Rubber was settled at 158 Chestnut Street in 1915, where it remained until his retirement in 1954. He was a member of the board of directors of the Tri-County automobile club before his election. The first campaign by Yoerg against Toepfert was unsuccessful. On October 30, 1935, Yoerg took out nomination papers again.Yoerg\'s campaign and win in the throes of the Great Depression were reported as unexpected by the Boston Herald. Yoerg\'s campaign chairman labeled the mayor "dictatorial" for his refusal to enforce traffic orders passed by the board of alderman for new stop signs and traffic patterns. He held 10 rallies in a single day to criticize the incumbent administration\'s actions as opaque and unresponsive, and appealed to many of its clubs and groups across ethnic and class lines.

His paintings in the Bloodline series are mostly portraits of Chinese people with large, dark-pupiled eyes, posed in a stiff manner reminiscent of family portraits from the 1950s and 1960s. For the first time, he created sculptures that were three dimensions in comparison to his "Bloodlines" portrait series. These sculptures have been featured in many exhibits and continue his work as one of China\'s leading, and most highly sought-after, contemporary artists. He was the third of four brothers to be born to parents who were both government officials in the city of Kunming in China\'s Yunnan province. <mask>\'s mother taught him how to draw as an exercise to keep him out of trouble. We were given paper and crayons to draw at home.I became more interested in art. I didn\'t have to go to school. My interest went up. I didn\'t give up on art after I became an adult. That\'s how I started to draw. The Chinese government took his parents away for 3 years. The Cultural Revolution, which took place in the 1960s and 1970s, influenced his painting.Xiaogang was sent to work on a farm in 1976, as part of the "Down to the Countryside Movement".

Xiaogang was accepted into the Sichuan Academy of Fine arts in 1977 after the reinstitution of collegiate entrance exams.At the time of his collegiate education, his professors continued to teach styles of Revolutionary Realism that were instituted by Chairman Mao. This encouraged Xiaogang and his peers to focus on western philosophy and individualism while avoiding political and ideological topics.

Gramscian thought was incorporated in Indian Marxism. His book was published in Calcutta in 1993. His first writing on theatre was on an actor from Beijing opera. The Jatra performances he saw in 1962 were the subject of his next article.He started interviewing contemporary stalwarts of Bangla theatre, such as Utpal Dutt and Badal Sircar, for further clarifications on their works.

He was active as a poet, scholar and possibly composer, as he is usually credited with an important collection of early sequences in Liber hymnorum. <mask> wrote Vita Sancti Galli and is commonly accepted to be the "Monk of Saint Gall" (Monachus Sangallensis) who wrote Gesta Karoli (the "deeds of Charlemagne"). He was contemporary with the fellow monks Tuotilo and Ratpert. Biography\n<mask> was born around 840, to a distinguished family. He would seem to have been born at Jonschwil on the River Thur, south of Wil, in what would become much later (in 1803) the canton of Saint Gall in Switzerland; some sources claim Elgg to be his place of birth. He studied with Tuotilo at Saint Gall\'s monastic school, and was taught by, and the Irishman, Moengall.He became a monk there and is mentioned as librarian in 890 and as master of guests in 892–4. He was chiefly active as a teacher, and displayed refinement of taste as poet and author. Ekkehard IV, the biographer of the monks of Saint Gall, lauds him as "delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine, a vessel of the Holy Spirit without equal in his time". He died in 912. He was beatified in 1512. Works\nHe completed Erchanbert\'s chronicle, arranged a martyrology, composed a metrical biography of Saint Gall, and authored other works. In his martyrology, he appeared to corroborate one of St Columba\'s miracles.St Columba, being an important father of Irish monasticism, was also important to St Gall and thus to <mask>\'s own monastery.

Mitsuhide rebelled against Nobunaga for unknown reasons in the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582, forcing the unprotected Nobunaga to commit seppuku in Kyoto. Mitsuhide attempted to establish himself as shōgun, but was pursued by Nobunaga\'s successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi and defeated at the Battle of Yamazaki.

Early life\n\n<mask> was born in New York on June 19, 1816. His father Isaac trained at the shipyard of New York shipbuilder <mask> Eckford before opening his own shipyard, Isaac Webb & Co., near Corlears Hook in about 1818, later relocating to Stanton Street. Isaac eventually took on a partner and the firm was renamed Webb & Allen. <mask> was educated privately and at Columbia College Grammar School, demonstrating a natural aptitude for mathematics. He built his first boat, a small skiff, at the age of twelve, and in spite of his parents' wishes to the contrary, secured an apprenticeship at his father's shipyard at the age of fifteen. At twenty, he was awarded a subcontract for the New York-Liverpool packet ship Oxford, his first commercial contract.Career\n\nAfter completing his six-year apprenticeship, <mask> decided to further his education by travelling to Scotland in 1840 to visit the famous shipyards of the Clyde. During this journey, however, his father Isaac died suddenly at the age of 46, and 23-year-old <mask> returned home to assume management of the shipyard. Upon examining the accounts, <mask> discovered that his father's business was technically insolvent, and thus one of his first duties was to settle his father's debts. Having done so, he set about reinvigorating the business. <mask> inherited his father's shipyard, Webb & Allen, in 1840, renamed it <mask> H. <mask>, and turned it into America's most prolific shipyard, building 133 vessels between 1840 and 1865. <mask> designed some of the fastest and most successful sailing packets and clipper ships ever built, and he also built some of the largest and most celebrated steamboats and steamships of his era, including the giant ironclad, in its day the world's longest wooden-hulled ship.

Listening to the classic French singers of the time on radio, such as Edith Piaf and Charles Trenet, inspired him as well. But his musical revelation came when he heard Félix Leclerc for the first time on the radio. From then on, he wanted to make music and, like Leclerc, sing simple, direct songs about everyday life. In 1954 Gauthier moved to Montreal where he worked for three years in the warehouse of the record dealer Édouard Archambault.After that he worked as a wilderness guide. All during this time he wrote songs and he was soon rewarded for his efforts. Encouraged to take part in a contest for singer-songwriters put on by CKVL, in Montreal, in 1959, he won first prize for "Le Soleil brillera demain" ("the sun will shine tomorrow"). He left his job and started singing in the coffee houses in Montreal accompanying himself on guitar. His songs from this period include: "Ton nom", ("Your Name") and "Le Grand six pieds" ("The Big Six-footer"). "Le Grand six pieds" was a big hit for him. It was based on memories of his early childhood, of the people, their struggle to make ends meet; it was a metaphor for the people of Quebec.First album\nHe was signed up by the Columbia Record company. Gauthier\'s first album was called <mask>er chante <mask>hier (Col FS-531). It included the song "Le Grand six pieds", which earned him the 1961, awarded by the Montreal radio station CKAC.

J. Richards and W. O<mask>, was a police informer and supposed agent provocateur at a time of social unrest, immediately after the Napoleonic Wars. The Luddite protests of 1811–15 had been followed by the Spa Fields riots of 1816, the Blanketeers demonstration in March 1817 and soon afterwards the Pentridge or Pentrich rising, in June, and it was a time when many of Britain’s middle and upper classes saw a genuine risk of revolution. The system of police informers was not new, but had largely escaped popular censure during the wars against France. In peacetime, it was more difficult to justify. Early life and family\nAlthough some early newspaper reports described <mask> as Welsh and a native of either Cardigan or Pembroke, in evidence to the Home Office he claimed to be from Pontesbury in Shropshire, England. He may have been baptised there in October 1774. He married Harriet Dear of Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, and they had a son.By the time he came to public notice he had been living for thirty years in London, and had worked as a carpenter and builder, and also latterly as a surveyor. He had not done well as a builder and he declared that he had lost money. He was described as "a person of genteel appearance and good address, nearly six feet high, of erect figure, light hair, red and rather large whiskers, and a full face, a little pitted with the small-pox. His usual dress... was a light fashionable coloured brown coat, black waistcoat, dark-blue mixture pantaloons, and Wellington boots". Career as informer\nOn 28 March 1817 <mask> approached the Home Office offering his services as an informer. He was accepted by Lord Sidmouth and on 23 April began a tour of the North and Midlands, ostensibly for the purpose of obtaining petitions for Parliamentary Reform and representing himself as a "Liberal patriot".

He was known to people who knew of the Gunpowder Plot to destroy the Parliament of England and kill King James I; and although his involvement is unclear, he was caught up in the subsequent investigation. He is a Roman Catholic martyr, and was beatified in 1929. Early life\nOldcorne was born in York in 1561, the son of <mask>, a bricklayer, and his wife Mary. His father was a Protestant, and his mother a Catholic who had spent some time in prison due to her faith.

Oldcorne was educated as a doctor, but later decided to enter the priesthood.He went to the English College at Reims, then to Rome where after ordination in 1587, he became a Jesuit in 1588. On the English mission\nIn late 1588 Oldcorne returned to England, in the company of Father John Gerard. In early 1589 he went with Father Henry Garnet to the West Midlands, visiting Coughton, Warwickshire and settling at Baddesley Clinton. He then worked chiefly in Worcestershire for 17 years. Oswald Tesimond assisted him after 1596; Father Thomas Lister, another Jesuit, also supported Oldcorne's mission but found the requirements of the covert life difficult. Oldcorne sometimes stayed with Thomas Abington, whose house at Hindlip Hall was near Baddesley Clinton. There he converted Thomas's sister Dorothy.The house was then was adapted by Nicholas Owen to help conceal Catholic priests.

He was the eldest of ten children of Gottschalk Diederich Bädeker (1778–1841), who had inherited the publishing house founded by his own father, Zacharias Gerhard Bädeker (1750–1800). The company also published the local newspaper, the Essendische Zeitung, and the family expected that <mask>, too, would eventually join the firm. <mask> changed the spelling of the family name from Bädeker with the umlaut to Baedeker around 1850. Biography \n\n<mask> was born in Essen, then in the Kingdom of Prussia, on November 3, 1801. After his schooling in Hagen, he left home in 1817 to study humanities in Heidelberg where he also worked for a while at the leading local bookseller J.C.B.Mohr. Military service followed, after which he moved to Berlin where he worked as an assistant at Georg Andreas Reimer, one of the leading booksellers in the city, from 1823 to 1825. He then returned home to Essen and worked with his father until 1827 when he left for Coblence (now Koblenz) to start his own bookselling and publishing business. Essen was then a small town with about 4000 inhabitants and he felt that Koblenz, which was not only larger, but was also the capital of the Prussian province of the Rhine and a hub for tourism, had far more to offer. In 1832, <mask>'s firm acquired the publishing house of Franz Friedrich Röhling in Koblenz, which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Oyvind Vorland entitled Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln; ein Handbuch für Schnellreisende (A Rhine Journey from Mainz to Cologne; A Handbook for Travellers on the Move).

Prior to her 2018 identification, <mask> was informally known as "Buckskin Girl" and "Miami County Jane Doe".

One of the three men, Greg Bridenbaugh, initially noticed the decedent\'s distinctive buckskin poncho. Informing one of his companions, <mask>, to take a look at the coat, <mask> walked closer to the article of clothing before turning toward Bridenbaugh, stating: "Oh my God, there\'s a woman in that coat!"

Knoch founded the Concordant Publishing Concern and translated the Concordant Version of the Bible. Life\nKnoch was raised in a German-speaking part of Missouri, born in St. Louis, Missouri as the son of <mask>, who had emigrated from Germany to the United States. One of his sisters, Addie, remained in Germany. Knoch grew up bilingually: in his parents\' house only German was spoken; Knoch learned English only at school. In 1885 the family moved to Los Angeles, where he completed high school in 1893. One of the teachers apparently told him that he had literary talent, and he should study great literature such as Shakespeare or the Bible.Since works by Shakespeare were not available, the young Knoch read in the family Bible. While at school, and thereafter (a total of around 20 years), he worked as a printer in the company of his brother. As part of a job, he came with a group, the "Plymouth Brethren", part of the Brethren Movement. Tutor McClure led <mask> in this group. He concurred with the teachings and was baptized. Because of his interest in languages, in 1900 at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, he studied "Ancient Greek, the NT in the proto-reading". In 1901 Knoch compared his translation output with the new American Standard Revised Version; he was disappointed.During this time he began developing a form of his concordant method of Bible translation. In the "Plymouth Brethren" he met Olive Hyde, another religious teacher; they married in April 1903. Knoch began to give Greek courses at the local YMCA. He discovered what he believed were additional mistakes in traditional translations and increasingly taught from the Greek to avoid teaching that of which he no longer was totally convinced. He began applying his systematic program with Biblical Greek to his writing work. On November 5, 1907, his son Ernest Oliver was born.

She was executed in 1834 for alleged apostasy from Islam—apparently without ever having converted to Islam. According to The Jewish Encyclopedia Hachuel "was a martyr to her faith, preferring death to becoming the bride of the sultan." She is considered a tzadeket (saint) by some Jews and is also revered by some Muslims. Jews call her <mask>kah ("the righteous <mask>"), while Arabs call her Lalla Suleika ("holy lady Suleika"). Hachuel\'s sacrifice served as an inspiration to painters and writers. One of the most detailed accounts, based on interviews with eyewitnesses, was written by Eugenio Maria Romero.His book El Martirio de la Jóven Hachuel, ó, La Heroina Hebrea (The Martyrdom of the Young Hachuel, or, The Hebrew Heroine) was first published in 1837 and republished in 1838. <mask>\'s story was also the subject of a song by Françoise Atlan on the CD Romances Sefardies.

Later Dubnow entered into a kazyonnoe yevreyskoe uchilishche (state Jewish school) where he learned Russian. In the midst of his education, the May Laws eliminated these Jewish institutions, and Dubnow was unable to graduate; Dubnow persevered, independently pursuing his interests in history, philosophy, and linguistics. He was particularly fascinated by Heinrich Graetz and the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement. In 1880 Dubnow used forged documents to move to St Petersburg, officially off-limits to Jews.Jews were generally restricted to small towns in the Pale of Settlement, unless they had been discharged from the military, were employed as doctors or dentists, or could prove they were 'cantonists', university graduates or merchants belonging to the 1st guild. Here he married Ida Friedlin. Soon after moving to St. Petersburg Dubnow's publications appeared in the press, including the leading Russian–Jewish magazine Voskhod. In 1890, the Jewish population was expelled from the capital city, and Dubnow too was forced to leave. He settled in Odessa and continued to publish studies of Jewish life and history, coming to be regarded as an authority in these areas. Throughout his active participation in the contemporary social and political life of the Russian Empire, Dubnow called for modernizing Jewish education, organizing Jewish self-defense against pogroms, and demanding equal rights for Russian Jews, including the right to vote.

His father Hanemon, who enjoyed sumo as much as sake, allowed 14-year-old <mask> to attend sumo classes at Nagaze (today called Murokocho), the neighbouring village. When Raiden was 17, the Urakaze-beya stablemaster noticed him when he came through the area while on jungyō (regional tour) with his wrestlers.He was especially impressed with the young man\'s physique, which was extraordinary at the time. Young Raiden was  tall, which was three head lengths taller than most of his contemporaries. He also had matching long arms and large hands; a handprint at the Shofukuji temple near Okayama, which is said to be of Raiden\'s hand, measures  from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger.

Soon Raiden left his stable and unofficially joined Isenoumi-beya, where yokozuna Tanikaze became his coach.Professional sumo career \nIn 1789, the shikona (wrestler name) "Raiden", which means "thunder bolt", appeared in the banzuke ranking, although Raiden did not have his debut until fall 1790.

He took up arms against the United States federal government to fight against encroachment by white American settlers on Native American territory and to preserve the traditional way of life of the Lakota people. His participation in several famous battles of the Black Hills War on the northern Great Plains, among them the Fetterman Fight in 1866, in which he acted as a decoy, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, in which he led a war party to victory, earned him great respect from both his enemies and his own people. In September 1877, four months after surrendering to U.S. troops under General George Crook, <mask> was fatally wounded by a bayonet-wielding military guard while allegedly resisting imprisonment at Camp Robinson in present-day Nebraska.

He appeared as a radiological technologist in a scene from the 1973 horror film The Exorcist, which was inspired when the film\'s director, William Friedkin, watched him perform a cerebral angiography the previous year. The scene, with a considerable amount of blood onscreen, was, for many viewers, the film\'s most disturbing scene; medical professionals have praised it for its realism.

Prior to <mask>\'s trial, police and prosecutors implicated him in a series of unsolved slayings of gay men in Manhattan, killings he had reportedly boasted about while in jail, bringing it up at his sentencing. However, no additional charges ever were brought against him. The experience inspired Friedkin to make the 1980 film Cruising which, while based on a novel written a decade earlier, incorporated in its storyline the city\'s leather subculture, with which Bateson had identified.In 2012, Friedkin recalled having visited the jailed <mask> prior to his trial, and having a conversation which suggested that either <mask> had committed the additional murders or merely that he was considering confessing to them for a lighter sentence.

Little is known about his life or his beliefs, but he is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers. The discovery of irrational numbers is said to have been shocking to the Pythagoreans, and Hippasus is supposed to have drowned at sea, apparently as a punishment from the gods for divulging this. However, the few ancient sources which describe this story either do not mention Hippasus by name (e.g. Pappus) or alternatively tell that Hippasus drowned because he revealed how to construct a dodecahedron inside a sphere. The discovery of irrationality is not specifically ascribed to Hippasus by any ancient writer.

Brownmiller argues that rape had been previously defined by men rather than women, and that men use it as a means of perpetuating male dominance by keeping all women in a state of fear. The New York Public Library selected Against Our Will as one of 100 most important books of the 20th century.

"I would like to be in close association with a man whose work I respect," she told an interviewer, attributing her unmarried status to the fact that she was "not willing to compromise." Education\nAs a child Brownmiller was sent to the East Midwood Jewish Center for two afternoons a week to learn Hebrew and Jewish history. She would later comment, "It all got sort of mishmashed in my brain except for one thread: a helluva lot of people over the centuries seemed to want to harm the Jewish people.... I can argue that my chosen path – to fight against physical harm, specifically the terror of violence against women – had its origins in what I had learned in Hebrew School about the pogroms and The Holocaust."

Surrealism\n\nAssociated with poet Robert Desnos and painter André Derain and the Surrealists, Savitry exhibited in 1929 at dealer Zborowski\'s gallery a sellout show, the catalogue essay of which was penned by celebrated Surrealist poet Louis Aragon (1897-1982). However, though on the threshold of artistic fame he decamped to Polynesia. Commentators propose different reasons for this decision; "He had more than one string to his art," wrote Claude Roy in 1972, "painting, photography, travel (and doing nothing). But what did not interest him was to be successful." (and as a wealthy man, despite the 1929 recession, Savitry did not need the proceeds of success); Barbara Creed notes that "The Surrealists saw travel as a means to achieve a state of dépaysement "; while another factor may have been the disagreements between the Surrealists over their association with Communism, which reached a climax with André Breton\'s letter of provocation to the group, and meeting with them on 11 March 1929, on the issue of working collectively, to which idea Savitry was amongst the majority of the group in responding positively, innocently naming the reluctant, and soon to be expelled, Desnos as a desirable collaborator.<mask> was accompanied on his journey to the tropics by surrealist painter Georges Malkin and Yvette Ledoux, a young American woman whom he\'d just met.

Nevertheless, the two brothers never gave up their royal aspirations and in 1670 Tsetsen murdered Sengge in a family coup. When <mask>\'s mother Amin-Dara arrived to Lhasa to inform <mask> of Sengge\'s death, <mask> immediately renounced his status as a lama and quickly returned to the Irtysh Valley to avenge him.

Prof. <mask> developed the first successful modern metal-on-metal hip resurfacing and the instrumentation and surgical technique to implant it. Hip resurfacing is a bone-conserving, less invasive alternative to total hip replacement (THR) for young patients, markedly improves the health-related quality of life measures and currently makes up around a tenth of all hip arthroplasty (artificial joint) procedures performed in the United Kingdom. <mask> is also the inventor of several other prostheses for the hip and knee. <mask> is the author of Modern Hip Resurfacing (), published in 2009. Hip Resurfacing\n\nBirmingham Hip Resurfacing\nProf. McMinn first began performing hip resurfacing procedures in 1991 using the McMinn Resurfacing. The rationale behind the procedure was that it would be a bone-conserving alternative to THR for patients with higher activity demands i.e.young patients with severe hip arthritis who are otherwise in good health. This would buy time until they reached an age at which they would be more suitable for a THR. THRs utilise small diameter metal-on-polyethylene bearings which have a high rate of dislocation and revision in this group of patients. Sir John Charnley originally developed the conventional THR in the 1950s, which proved to be one of the most successful operations in the world. In this procedure the 'ball' part of the hip joint (femoral head) and a portion of its neck are removed and the'socket' part (acetabulum) is grated in preparation. These are replaced with an artificial ball and socket with a long stem in the thigh bone. This and other designs of THRs have since transformed the quality of life of millions of old patients with severe hip arthritis.Because these devices contained polyethylene as one of the rubbing surfaces, Charnley was justifiably very wary of using it in young patients.

He had business dealings with Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, and his catalogs and advertisements are still employed today as a source for historical musicology. Life and career\nHe was born in Gochsheim in Bavaria, and had moved to Vienna by 1779. He began his work simply by offering hand copies of musical works, working out of his home. This was possible even in the late 18th century, for as David Wyn Jones notes, Austria was at the time not very technologically advanced in this respect:\n\nMusic-printing was becoming increasingly widespread in the 18th century... In those areas of Europe like Britain, France, and northern Germany, where music-publishing was well established, printed copies of instrumental music became the principal means of dissemination... On the other hand, in [other] parts of Europe, principally the Austrian monarchy, southern Germany, Italy, and the Iberian peninsula,... copying of music by hand remained the principal means of dissemination for all music through Haydn's lifetime [1732–1809]. As Jones as elsewhere pointed out, what set Traeg apart from most professional copyists was his assiduous compilation of what became a vast library of music from which he could offer copies for sale.Jones suggests that the several changes of residence recorded for Traeg in his advertisements may have been needed to house the expanding collection, and indeed Traeg eventually moved his family out to the suburbs and placed the collection in his own shop, whose opening was advertised 16 May 1789, and which became a destination for Viennese music-lovers for the rest of his life. As of 9 April 1794, Traeg entered the publication business per se, with issue of printed copies of quartets by Joseph Eybler; this business eventually flourished. Traeg retained his offerings of hand-copied music, however.

Diefenbach is regarded as the "forefather of alternative movements" and one of the most important champions of the Lebensreform (life-reform), the Freikörperkultur (naturism) and the peace movement. His rural commune Himmelhof, in Ober Sankt Veit near Vienna (1897–1899) was the model for the reform settlement Monte Verità near Ascona, founded by his student Gustav Gräser, who is also known as the "Grail of Modernity". As a painter, <mask> was an independent representative of symbolism. Life\n\nBorn in Hadamar in Hesse, then part of the Duchy of Nassau, <mask> was the son of, a painter and drawing teacher at Hadamarer Gymnasium. Diefenbach attended this Gymnasium and received his first artistic lessons from his father. He then studied at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts and was impressed by Arnold Böcklin and Franz von Stuck.<mask> received attention and recognition early on, but his endeavours were temporarily cut short; his right arm was crippled as a result of severe typhoid fever and a botched operation. He had to learn all activities, which included writing and painting, with his left hand.

With around 1500 documented strophes of his songs surviving, Neidhart has the largest corpus of surviving lyrics of any, suggesting the great popularity of the songs. In addition, and quite unlike any of his contemporaries, many melodies to his songs have been preserved: manuscripts have almost 70 melodies to 55 of his songs. Neidhart\'s lyrics are highly innovative: into the courtly genre of Minnesang, he introduced peasant characters, who are often shown in conflict with the knightly class. Both classes are sometimes treated as objects of satire. His songs are traditionally divided into summer and winter songs (), each group opening with a piece of seasonal description  of nature. But there are also songs which fall outside these categories and which in the past were often regarded as the work of later imitators.Neidhart\'s works continued to enjoy great popularity long after his death. He was transformed into the legendary, peasant-hating "Neidhart Fuchs" in late 15th century comical stories (German ), and he also had a legacy in the visual arts, with woodcuts, frescos and carved reliefs portraying scenes from his songs. Life\nIn spite of the enduring popularity of his songs, there are no documentary sources for Neidhart\'s life. While the songs seem to offer a great deal of biographical, geographical, and historical information, this material relates to a poetic persona — a biographical basis cannot be assumed. The song collections consistently give his name as Nîthart or, in its later Early New High German form, Neidhart. While the songs mention a knight von Riuwental, the identification of the poet with this knight is not found until the 15th century, and then in texts geographically remote from Neidhart\'s sphere of activity in Bavaria and Austria.

From 1986 to 1999, he and his family members and associates forced them into servitude and sexual slavery. <mask> came to the United States in 1960 to study engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. By 1975, <mask> had opened a successful Indian cuisine restaurant in downtown Berkeley. He used its profits to purchase over 1,000 run-down apartments, making him, by the year 2000, the largest and wealthiest landlord in the city (other than the University of California), with a worth estimated at. In 2000, <mask> was indicted by the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California who charged him with sex trafficking, visa fraud, and tax code violations following a lengthy investigation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, and the Berkeley Police Department.On June 21, 2001, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California announced that <mask> pled guilty to one count of conspiring to commit immigration fraud, two counts of transportation of minors for illegal sexual activity, and one count of subscribing to a false tax return for which he was fined  and sentenced to serve a prison term of 97 months (8 years 1 month) in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. <mask>'s case ultimately served as the building block for California's anti-trafficking movement.

Paintings in his Bloodline series are predominantly monochromatic, stylized portraits of Chinese people, usually with large, dark-pupiled eyes, posed in a stiff manner deliberately reminiscent of family portraits from the 1950s and 1960s. Recently, he also created sculptures, translating for the first time into three dimensions many characters of the sort seen in his "Bloodlines—Big Family" portrait series.

Though the daughter of <mask> and a Sicilian noblewoman, she was of humble origins. Macalda was noted for her unscrupulous political conduct, inclination to betray marriage (political and human), and for her easy and promiscuous sexual habits; this dissoluteness, even having a brush with "suspicion of incest," tended to degenerate into an "exhibitionism veined with nymphomania." She was the wife of the Grand Justiciar of the Kingdom of Sicily,. Proud Amazon, educated in arms and courage, gifted with a martial bearing, moved by a cynical and ambitious nature, Macalda\'s vigorous feminine personality deployed her influence first in the circle of Charles of Anjou and then at the court of Peter III of Aragon, whom, according to a chronicler of the time, Macalda tried to seduce, but without success. Her qualities made her a protagonist in the foreground of this important epoch of transition and violent upheavals in the history of the Kingdom of Sicily that was marked by the bloody revolt of the Sicilian Vespers and led to the tumultuous alternation between Angevin and Aragonese rule.Practicing intrigue at court, but also brazenly vying with Queen Constance of Hohenstaufen, Macalda indeed had an important role in at first favoring, and then toppling, the political fortunes of her second husband, the aged Alaimo da Lentini, who had been one of the major champions of the Sicilian Vespers. Macalda\'s social and political trajectory, given her very humble ancestry, can be considered as an exemplary and paradigmatic case of the type of social mobility through which, in a late medieval Norman or Swabian context, an ambitious family could achieve emancipation from poverty and from subaltern positions in a few generations, a spectacular journey that starting from misery could attain \n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nMacalda\n', '\nPhisit Pr', '\nZahir\n', '\nMukesh\n', '\nMary Sarvis\n', '\nAnantharaman', '\nJimmy Buffett', '\nPatrick Lalor\n', '\nJean de La Ro', '\nKulwicki', '\nHằng', '\nWilliam Danby\n', "The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> (1602 – 1659) was an Italian educator, author, and poet.

They called it Il Conventino. The school itself was named the Congregation of the Ancille della Santissima Vergine or Handmaidens of the Blessed Virgin. Women from different backgrounds were welcome at Il Conventino. According to Jennifer Haraguchi, <mask> struggled to “reconcile her desire to provide education to young women of all social classes with the Florentine Church’s position which at the time did not include the education of the poor.” \n\nEventually Montalvo desired to separate the girls of higher social status away from the girls of lower social class. In 1650 Montalvo opened a second conservatory for aristocratic girls located at Villa La Quiete. The school was named the Congregation of the Ancille della Santissima Trinità or Handmaidens of the Blessed Trinity.Though they were separate, Montalvo “advocated a combined instruction in religion, morals, reading, music, and dramatic performance” at both schools.

Before that, Eichel served as the 6th Minister President of Hesse from 1991 to 1999 and as the 52nd President of the Bundesrat in 1998/99. During his time in office, Eichel played a very important role in two landmark reforms – the far reaching reform of German society and economy (also known as Agenda 2010) and the creation of the G-20 to reflect the rebalancing of world power. Some argue that Agenda 2010 helped turn Germany from the\'sick man of Europe\' into the best performing major Western economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. While some parties regarded it as the most successful economic reforms in Germany in over half a century, as well as in any G7 country in 30 years, it also created massive controversy and protests.The effects of the Agenda 2010 on German economic development remain disputed. As chairman of the G7, Eichel initiated the creation of the G20 together with then US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and hosted its inaugural meeting in Berlin. The G20 rapidly grew to become the most influential economic body in the world. <mask> went on to serve as chairman of the G20 in 2004, when he pressed for the reforming of the international financial architecture and establishing a code of conduct on preventing financial crises.

He is also remembered for isolating, by using electricity, a series of elements for the first time: potassium and sodium in 1807 and calcium, strontium, barium, magnesium and boron the following year, as well as for discovering the elemental nature of chlorine and iodine. <mask> also studied the forces involved in these separations, inventing the new field of electrochemistry. <mask> is also credited to have been the first to discover clathrate hydrates in his lab. In 1799 he experimented with nitrous oxide and was astonished at how it made him laugh, so he nicknamed it "laughing gas" and wrote about its potential anaesthetic properties in relieving pain during surgery. <mask> was a baronet, President of the Royal Society (PRS), Member of the Royal Irish Academy (MRIA), Fellow of the Geological Society (FGS), and a member of the American Philosophical Society (elected 1810).

Early life and contact with the English \nLittle is known of Hiacoomes\' early life except that he was of\'mean\' descent and described as "a man of a sad and sober spirit" who had a low ranking in the then existing social hierarchy of the Wampanoag. In 1639 the first English settlement of the island, under the direction of Thomas Mayhew Senior, had begun at Edgartown. Hiacoomes took an unusual interest in these newcomers and eventually began to form relationships with some of the English with whom he visited in their houses and they in his wigwam. He even attended religious meetings, where he managed to catch the curiosity of Thomas Mayhew Junior (1618?–1657), son of the island\'s governor and local pastor to the English. Seeing this curiosity, the younger Mayhew invited Hiacoomes to his house each Sabbath evening where the soon-to-be missionary to the Indians would teach and instruct his native charge in the doctrines and ideas of Puritanism.Under his direction, Hiacoomes became a professed Christian, learning how to read in the process.

William Dufty describes the background ("Nyoiti" is a variant transcription of "Nyoichi"):\nThe gradual introduction of sugar into the Japanese diet brought in its wake the beginning of Western diseases. A Japanese midwife, trained in the techniques of Western medicine as a nurse, fell ill and was abandoned as incurable by the Western doctors she had espoused. Three of her children died the same way. The fourth, Nyoiti Sakurazawa, rebelled at the notion of dying of tuberculosis and ulcers in his teens. He took up the study of ancient Oriental medicine which had been officially outlawed in Japan. Sakurazawa was attracted to the unorthodox career of a famous Japanese practitioner, Dr. Sagen Ishizuka.Thousands of patients had been cured by Ishizuka (through traditional use of food) after they had been abandoned as incurable by the new medicine of the West. Ohsawa writes in his books that he cured himself of tuberculosis at the age of 19 by applying the ancient Chinese concept of yin and yang  as well as the teachings of Sagen Ishizuka.

Career\n\nEarly work\n<mask> studied at the San Francisco Art Institute, one of his teachers there was the famous avant-garde director Rosa von Praunheim.In the early 1970s, while still in art school, Ferrara directed a number of independently produced short films which included The Hold Up and Could This Be Love. Finding himself out of work after leaving film school in 1976, Ferrara directed his first feature film which was an adult pornographic film titled, 9 Lives of a Wet Pussy, using a pseudonym. Starring with his then-girlfriend, he recalled having to step in front of the camera for one scene to perform in a hardcore sex scene: "It\'s bad enough paying a guy $200 to fuck your girlfriend, then he can\'t get it up." Ferrara first drew a cult following with his second feature film, a grindhouse movie titled The Driller Killer (1979), an urban slasher film about an artist (played by the director himself) who goes on a killing spree with a power drill.

He saw the Germanization of Polish territories controlled by the German Empire as the major threat to Polish culture and therefore advocated a degree of accommodation with another power that had partitioned Poland, the Russian Empire. He favored the re-establishment of Polish independence by nonviolent means, and supported policies favorable to the Polish middle class. During World War I, in Paris, through his Polish National Committee he was a prominent spokesman, to the Allies for Polish aspirations. He was an instrumental figure in the postwar restoration of Poland\'s independent existence. <mask> never wielded significant political power, except for a brief period in 1923 as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Nevertheless, he was one of the most influential Polish ideologues and politicians of his time.A controversial personality most of his life, <mask> believed that only a homogenous Polish-speaking and Roman Catholic-practicing nation would be preferable as opposed to Piłsudski\'s vision of Prometheism which sought a multi-ethnic Poland reminiscent of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth instead. As a result, his thinking marginalized other ethnic groups living in Poland, particularly those in the Kresy (which included Jews, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians) and he was regarded as anti-Semite. He remains a key figure of Polish nationalism and has been frequently referred to as "the father of Polish nationalism".

I sometimes start a house with a Romanesque corner, pretend that it has fallen into disrepair and been added to in the Gothic spirit, when suddenly the great wealth of the New World has poured in and the owner had added a very rich Renaissance addition." Or as he described his own never-built castle, drawings of which were part of his promotional literature, it would be "a Spanish fortress of the twelfth century captured from its owner by a stronger enemy who, after taking it, adds on one wing and another, and then loses it in turn to another who builds to suit his taste." As these quotes suggest, many Mizner buildings contain styles from more than one period, but all foreign.

In 1893, the Imperial Geographical Society commissioned <mask>, along with Balakirev and Anatoly Lyadov, to gather folksongs from the regions of Vologda, Vyatka (now Kirov) and Kostroma.

After graduating from Emory University in Georgia in 1990, <mask> traveled across North America and eventually hitchhiked to Alaska in April 1992. There, he entered the Alaskan bush with minimal supplies, hoping to live simply off the land. On the eastern bank of the Sushana River, <mask> found an abandoned bus, Fairbanks Bus 142, which he used as a makeshift shelter until his death. In September, his decomposing body, weighing only, was found inside the bus by a hunter. <mask>\'s cause of death was officially ruled to be starvation, although the exact circumstances relating to his death remain the subject of some debate.In January 1993, Krakauer published an article about McCandless in that month\'s issue of Outside magazine. He had been assigned the story and had written it under a tight deadline. Inspired by the details of <mask>\'s story, Krakauer wrote the biographical book Into the Wild, which was subsequently adapted into a 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, with Emile Hirsch portraying McCandless.

He is a Sayyid, direct descendant of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad through Zayd ibn Ali, son of Imam Zayn al-Abidin. Other imams in the Cape were mostly teaching the Shafi`i school of Islamic jurisprudence; he was a follower and the first teacher of Hanafi school, for which he also established a madrassa in Cape Town. He gained notoriety in 1869 after ruling that rock lobster and snoek, two staple foods in the Cape, were sinful (haraam).He has often been mistaken for being a Shafi\'i on the basis of him being a Scholar of the 4 schools of Sunni Islam, and being able to issue religious edicts according to each one. His ancestors and children practised the Hanafi school of thought. He died after contracting malaria from reportedly travelling to Dera Mozambique, after having made several major contributions to Islam in South Africa.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest symphonic and operatic conductors of the 20th century. He was a major influence for many later conductors, and his name is often mentioned when discussing their interpretative styles. Furtwängler was principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic between 1922 and 1945, and from 1952 until 1954. He was also principal conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra (1922–26), and was a guest conductor of other major orchestras including the Vienna Philharmonic. Although not an adherent of Nazism, he was the leading conductor to remain in Germany during the Nazi regime. Despite his open opposition to antisemitism and the ubiquity of Nazi symbolism, the regime did not seek to suppress him, at Joseph Goebbels' insistence, for propaganda reasons.This situation caused lasting controversy, and the extent to which his presence lent prestige to Nazi Germany is still debated. Life and career\n\n<mask>ängler was born in Schöneberg (now a district/borough of Berlin) into a prominent family. His father Adolf was an archaeologist, his mother a painter. Most of his childhood was spent in Munich, where his father taught at the city's Ludwig Maximilian University. He was given a musical education from an early age, and developed an early love of Ludwig van Beethoven, a composer with whose works he remained closely associated throughout his life. Although Furtwängler achieved fame chiefly from his conducting, he regarded himself foremost as a composer. He began conducting in order to perform his own works.By age of twenty, he had composed several works. However, they were not well received, and that, combined with the financial insecurity of a career as a composer, led him to concentrate on conducting. He made his conducting debut with the Kaim Orchestra (now the Munich Philharmonic) in Anton Bruckner's Ninth Symphony.

He was nominated as OMB Director by President-elect Donald Trump in December 2016 and confirmed by Senate vote (51–49) on. Mulvaney was known for his support for fiscal conservatism as a congressman, which included a willingness to shut down the government during Barack Obama\'s presidency.However, as OMB Director in the Trump administration, he oversaw an expansion in the deficit. The deficit increases were a result of both spending increases and tax cuts, and were unusually high for a period of economic expansion. In 2019, with regard to its potential mention in an upcoming State of the Union address, Mulvaney said "nobody cares" about the deficit. A staunch opponent of the CFPB while in Congress, Mulvaney\'s tenure as acting Director of the bureau led to a considerable reduction of the bureau\'s enforcement and regulatory powers.

Pann was an influential folklorist and collector of proverbs, as well as a lexicographer and textbook author. Biography\n\nEarly years\nPann was born sometime between 1794 and 1798, in Sliven, Rumelia (in today's Bulgaria). According to some accounts, his mother, Tomaida, was an ethnic Greek, while his father, Pantoleon Petrov, was Bulgarian; it is known that he worked as a coppersmith bucket-maker. There is a commonly held view by Romani community activists, who consider Pann among the most prominent Romani artists. This view is also accepted by some Romanian authors. Various other interpretations state that Pantoleon Petrov, who died during <mask>'s childhood, was Bulgarian, Aromanian, or Romanian.The writer, who was the youngest of Petrov and Tomaida's three sons, eventually adopted the family name <mask>, as a colloquial contraction of his father's given name. After he began primary education at the communal school in Sliven, the Petrovs fled the region during the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812 and settled in Chișinău, Bessarabia, where <mask> was first employed by a Russian Orthodox choir. His two brothers were killed in the skirmishes around Brăila, as volunteers on the Imperial Russian side. Moving with his mother to Bucharest in 1810-1812, Pann would spend most of his life in the city. <mask> carried on with his choral activities in Wallachia, was employed as a sexton by the Romanian Orthodox  and Sfinților Churches, before being tutored by the Greek musician Dionysios Foteinos (1777–1821) and allowed to attend the religious music school founded by Petros Ephesios (d. 1840).

He has a brother, Bryce (who had a successful college baseball career at the University of Nebraska), and a sister, Kristen. He wanted to be a bull rider as a child. He grew up a Colorado Rockies fan. Nimmo attended Cheyenne East High School in Cheyenne.As Wyoming is one of only three states that do not offer high school baseball, Nimmo played American Legion Baseball. In, he batted.448 with 15 home runs and 34 stolen bases in 70 games for his club, Post 6. The Mets scouted Nimmo's Legion games and other events. One such event was the 2010 Under Armour All-America Baseball Game at Wrigley Field, where Nimmo went 2-for-4 with a triple, two runs scored and two runs batted in to earn co-MVP honors with pitcher Nick Burdi.

According to critic Alex Ross, no recent classical composer has had as much commercial success as Górecki. He became a leading figure of the Polish avant-garde during the post-Stalin cultural thaw. His Anton Webern-influenced serialist works of the 1950s and 1960s were characterized by adherence to dissonant modernism and influenced by Luigi Nono, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Krzysztof Penderecki and Kazimierz Serocki. He continued in this direction throughout the 1960s, but by the mid-1970s had changed to a less complex sacred minimalist sound, exemplified by the transitional Symphony No. 2 and the Symphony No. 3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs).This later style developed through several other distinct phases, from such works as his 1979 Beatus Vir, to the 1981 choral hymn Miserere, the 1993 Kleines Requiem für eine Polka and his requiem Good Night. Górecki was largely unknown outside Poland until the late 1980s. In 1992, 15 years after it was composed, a recording of his Symphony of Sorrowful Songs with soprano Dawn Upshaw and conductor David Zinman, released to commemorate the memory of those lost during the Holocaust, became a worldwide commercial and critical success, selling more than a million copies and vastly exceeding the typical lifetime sales of a recording of symphonic music by a 20th-century composer. Commenting on its popularity, Górecki said, "Perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music [...] somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." This popular acclaim did not generate wide interest in Górecki\'s other works, and he pointedly resisted the temptation to repeat earlier success, or compose for commercial reward.Nevertheless, his music drew the attention of Australian film director Peter Weir, who used a section of Symphony No 3 in\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nGórecki', 'The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> (born December 8, 1987) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent.

Variations include: Grymbaud, Grymbold, Grymbolde, Grimbold, Grimald, Grimbald, and Grymbalde.There has been no evidence of Grimald ever being married or having children.

The first of a succession of four Salian emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, <mask> ruled the kingdoms of Germany (from 1024), Italy (from 1026), and Burgundy (from 1033). The son of Franconian count Henry of Speyer (also Henry of Worms) and Adelaide of Metz of the Matfriding dynasty, that had ruled the Duchy of Lorraine from 959 until 972, <mask> inherited the titles of count of Speyer and Worms during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the princes of the kingdom. When the imperial dynastic line was left without a successor after Emperor Henry II\'s death in 1024, on 4 September an assembly of the imperial princes appointed the 34 year-old <mask> king (Rex romanorum). <mask> II largely continued the political course, the Renovatio regni Francorum of his Ottonian predecessor Henry II regarding the role and organisation of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the Proprietary church as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire.Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (Honor Imperii), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of Rome and its curia in particular. His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire. Upon the death of the childless King Rudolph III of Burgundy in 1032, <mask> claimed dominion over the Kingdom of Burgundy, conquered it and incorporated it into the empire.

At an early age Kertész showed a great affinity for music, and began violin lessons. "When I was six and started music," he told a High Fidelity interviewer, "it was 1935 and cruel things were going on in Europe...

She divided her career with equal success between the operatic stage and the concert platform and was an accomplished recitalist. Operatic career\n\n"A singer of unusual intelligence" – The Times, 1968\nHailed by the critics as a singer "of unusual intelligence with real command of a big soprano range and quite exceptional gifts of coloring and characterization" (The Times), at her recital debut in 1968 at the Wigmore Hall, her debut at Covent Garden with Georg Solti followed, and she was immediately offered several principal guest roles. However, her career progress was unexpectedly halted by problems relating to the birth of her daughter in 1970. Setbacks overcome\nShe overcame these and, with  a series of landmark opera performances intended to put her career back on track, again received outstanding critical acclaim.William Mann of The Times described her singing of the title role in Donizetti\'s Lucrezia Borgia in 1977 as "brilliant, musicianly and grandly expressive". But a further setback forced her to change course just as new offers began to arrive, including a  return to Covent Garden in the role of First Lady in Die Zauberflöte. Her voice was changing and a switch to the mezzo-soprano repertoire was indicated. The effect of these two major setbacks meant that <mask> never became more widely known. But the quality of her work over a period of forty years was never in doubt as evidenced by the unusually lavish praise that consistently greeted her performances, from her student days in the early 1960s onwards, whether as soprano or mezzo.

In 392 BC, <mask> entered her horses in the Olympics for a second time and was awarded another victory in the same event. Etymology \nCynisca\'s name means "female puppy" in Ancient Greek, and she was named after her grandfather Zeuxidamus, who was called Cyniscos. It is possible that this name is derived from the hunting traditions of the Spartan elite, or her family\'s practice of raising hunting dogs.

Because of her family\'s wealth, Cynisca was able to spend time developing her sporting skills and learning how to train horses for chariot racing, paving the way for her future Olympic victories. According to Pausanias, Cynisca was exceedingly ambitious to succeed at the Olympic Games from a young age. Several sources from Xenophon and Plutarch make mention of how, in her youth, Cynisca\'s brother Agesilaus encouraged her to breed horses and compete in the games, though his motivations for doing so have recently been debated. According to these ancient sources, Agesilaus supposedly viewed success in chariot racing as a victory without merit. As opposed to other events, where a man\'s bravery and virtue were the decisive factors, he believed that chariot racing only demonstrated wealth due to the lack of involvement on the part of the horses\' owner. Both of these ancient authors suggested that Agesilaus hoped to expose how the sport was unmanly and aristocratic by having a woman win, though in reality Cynisca\'s victories did not stop wealt\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nCynisca', 'The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> (; born January 31, 1981) is an Israeli professional basketball player for Elitzur Yavne of the Israeli National League.

He is a climber with a pedigree in stage races, having finished in the top ten of the Tour de France and Vuelta a España several times. Biography\n\nKelme–Costa Blanca (1998–2003)\nBorn in Ossa de Montiel, Albacete Province, Sevilla turned professional in 1998 for Spanish team, and his big breakthrough came in the 2001 Tour de France. Here, he showed himself as a great climber, ranking 7th in the overall General classification, and winning the young rider classification as the rider of 25 years of age or younger with the highest position in the general classification. After the Tour de France, he continued his great form in the 2001 Vuelta a España. He wore the leader's jersey until the final uphill time trial stage in Madrid, which he lost to winner Ángel Casero. In the 2002 Vuelta a España, intra-team rivalry with Aitor González saw him finish fourth in the General classification, despite the team's initial assurances that he would be the only leader.González's racing in the very difficult Angliru mountain stage saw <mask> lose valuable time that he was not able to recover in the later stages of the race, and Gonzalez took over the lead on the final stage, overtaking previous leader Roberto Heras.

She was the daughter, possibly the third surviving daughter, of the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus and the sister of the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus. Family background\nAemilia belonged to the patrician gens Aemilia, one of the most famous families of the Roman Republic. Roman women of the Middle Republic customarily bore their father\'s family name and were sometimes distinguished by their birth order. As with men named Quintus ("the Fifth") or Sextus ("the Sixth"), a name such as Tertia may not always mean a woman had two older sisters. Valerius Maximus gives her name as Tertia Aemilia, "the wife of Scipio Africanus and the mother of Cornelia." Aemilia is not known to have had sisters.<mask> <mask>\'s marriage to Scipio Africanus took place no later than 215 BC. They were very happily married, according to Livy, Polybius, and other classical historians. Character of Aemilia\nAemilia was gentle, mild-mannered, but also fiercely loyal to her husband who upset many Senators by challenging the older leaders in their military strategy, and conservative Romans by his adoption of some parts of Greek lifestyle. The Greek historian Polybius who was living in the household of her brother Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus for some time, and who almost certainly was an eye-witness, wrote of Aemilia Tertia:  \n"This lady whose name was Aemilia, used to display great magnificence whenever she left her house to take part in the ceremonies that women attend, having participated in the fortune of Scipio when he was at the height of his prosperity...

She began her service as his secretary at the age of 17. By her early twenties, she had become entrusted with the executive decision making within Gandhi\'s law practice and sociopolitical movements. Gandhi said "during the Satyagraha days... she led the movement single handed". She was a lifelong friend to Gandhi and would have been a fellow lawyer if she had not been female. She ended her career as a teacher of Latin and made a late attempt to become a lawyer at the age of 65.

She was recommended for a job by the architect Hermann Kallenbach to a new immigrant Indian lawyer named Mohandas Gandhi. Kallenbach described her as honest and clever, but mischievous and impetuous. Gandhi was so impressed by Schlesin and her speed at shorthand that he offered her a generous wage which she turned down for a more modest figure initially suggested by Kallenbach. Schlesin told Gandhi that she wanted to work for him because she supported his work and not for the money that he was offering. She affectionately called her employer Gandhi \'Bapu\' (Father). Gandhi would take on large administrative and important tasks.In 1904 he persuaded the authorities to rehouse gold mine workers in the Transvaal where the pneumonic plague was taking a toll. Gandhi had taken on the problem and his legal office team had been reassigned to nursing for the sick.

The longest-reigning monarch in Iranian history, he reigned for the entirety of his 70-year life, from 309 to 379. He was the son of Hormizd II (r. 302–309). His reign saw the military resurgence of the country, and the expansion of its territory, which marked the start of the first Sasanian golden era. He is thus along with <mask>, Kavad I and Khosrow I, regarded as one of the most illustrious Sasanian kings. His three direct successors, on the other hand, were less successful. At the age of 16, he launched enormously successful military campaigns against Arab insurrections and tribes who knew him as \'Dhū\'l-Aktāf ("he who pierces shoulders").<mask> II pursued a harsh religious policy. Under his reign, the collection of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, was completed, heresy and apostasy were punished, and Christians were persecuted. The latter was a reaction against the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. <mask> II, like <mask> I, was amicable towards Jews, who lived in relative freedom and gained many advantages in his period (see also Rava). At the time of <mask>\'s death, the Sasanian Empire was stronger than ever, with its enemies to the east pacified and Armenia under Sasanian control. Etymology \n"Shapur" was a popular name in Sasanian Iran, being used by three Sasanian monarchs and other notables of the Sasanian era and its later periods. Derived from Old Iranian *xšayaθiya.puθra ("son of a king"), it must initially have been a title, which became—at least in the late 2nd century AD—a personal name.It appears in the list of Arsacid kings in some Arabic-Persian sources, however, this is anachronistic.

Career\n\nDeane and <mask>\n\n<mask> was the manager for the London arms manufacturers George & John Deane. On August 22, 1851, he was granted a British patent for a new revolver design. The.436 Deane and <mask> was a five-shot percussion (cap-and-ball) revolver with a spurless hammer, and the first revolver with a solid frame. The revolver used a double-action only system in which the external hammer could not be cocked by thumbing it back, like most other pistols of the era, but instead cocked itself when the trigger was pulled. This made it possible to fire the gun much more rapidly than contemporary single-action revolvers, such as the Colt, which had to be cocked before each shot.Deane and <mask>\' revolver was shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and subsequently approved by the British Army\'s Small Arms Committee in addition to being adopted by the East India Company for use by their cavalry. Orders for the revolver were great enough to prompt the Deane brothers to make <mask> a partner in their firm, which became Messrs. Deane, Adams, and Deane. Although highly regarded, the hand-crafted Adams revolver was more expensive than Colt\'s mass-produced guns. It lacked a  recoil shield behind the cylinder, which left the shooter\'s hand subject to powder burns resulting from "blowback" caused by the sometimes unpredictable black powder of the era. The lack of a hammer spur was criticized since the longer trigger pull of the Adams made it less accurate than the Colt. Furthermore, the Adams\' nipples, upon which the percussion caps were set, were unhardened and sometimes burst upon firing. An "Improved Frame" model was offered in 1854, presenting both a sleeker look and more comfortable grip.In that same year the British Board of Ordnance revie\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nDeane and <', '\nRajya Sab', '\nFoppa\n', '\nJohn C.

Early in his life he was taken by the Wynn family to its Ystumllyn estate in Criccieth, where he was christened with the Welsh name <mask>umllyn. Here he was taught English and Welsh by the locals. He learned horticulture and craftsmanship, at which he had some natural skill, in the estate garden. He worked as a gardener at the estate and eventually "grew into a handsome and vigorous young man", his portrait painted at around this time. Doted upon by several local girls, he began a romance with the local maid Margaret Gruffydd.As Margaret moved to different employments Ystumllyn followed her, eventually running away from his job as gardener to marry in 1768. They had seven children, five of whom survived, with several of their descendants still living in the area. They initially worked as land stewards, but Ystumllyn eventually re-entered into the employment of the Wynn family. In recognition of his service Ellis Wynn gave Ystumllyn a large garden and cottage at Y Nhyra Isa. Ystumllyn died in 1786; his wife, Margaret, lived for more than forty years more. Ystumllyn was well-liked in his lifetime and met with little racial prejudice, though locals often expressed surprise at his unfamiliar appearance. Several years after his death, a small monument was constructed in his place of burial St Cynhaearn\'s Church.Over a hundred years after Ystumllyn\'s death, the Welsh writer Robert Isaac Jones published an account of Ystumllyn\'s life compiled from various local oral records. This work, while also criticised for its "forgetfulness" and "racial stereotyping", serves as "the most informative" extant source of Ystumllyn\'s life.

He is also the co-founder of NahNotOutsideMyHouse! Productions. Stage career\n\nOne of <mask>\' earliest professional stage appearances was in December 1996, when he was a member of the Waterloo Bridge Theatre Company. He appeared in two plays in one evening: Oscar Wilde\'s The Importance of Being Earnest and Anton Chekhov\'s The Bear. In Earnest, he played the roles of Merriman and Lane and in The Bear, he played the role of Luka. His versatility was noted by John Attanas of the Off-Off Broadway Review (OOBR), who remarked, "... the most versatile actor of the evening was Paul Goncalves, who played three different servants over the course of both shows, and played them in the most distinctly different ways imaginable."A year later, in 1997, Gonçalves starred in the monodrama Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God, which was written and directed by childhood friend Charles Messina, and which debuted at the Sanford Meisner Theatre in New York City on 24 November, at 6:48 pm – the 6th anniversary of Freddie Mercury\'s death. Mark Marone of Billboard magazine said of Gonçalves\' performance: \n\nGonçalves bears a striking resemblance to the legendary vocalist and presents a passionate performance of human frailty against the backdrop of a superstar who had it all....

He composed the most pieces in the Chantilly Codex, the principal source of music of the ars subtilior, the manneristic compositional school centered on Avignon at the end of the century. Life \nNothing is known about <mask>\'s life, beyond what can be inferred from the texts to his music. Even his name is a puzzle. One possibility is that the single name "Solage" is a nickname or pseudonym, similar to others known from the period, such as Grimace or Hasprois. "Solage" and "soulage" are variant spellings of Old French solaz, solace, meaning "consolation", "joy", or "entertainment". In the refrain to the text of Calextone qui fut dame, the composer refers to himself with such a double meaning, using the spelling "soulage".However, the possibility that it is a genuine name cannot be ruled out. One of the attributions in the Chantilly Codex includes the initial J wrapped into the name, so it is possible his first name was. There are many references from that time to people called Jean Soulas (a name still found in modern times), and the surname Soulage or Soulages also existed (for example, Guillaume de Soulages, count of Canillac, documented from a wedding in 1392), though there are no clear candidates for the composer. Gilbert Reaney\'s suggestion that the composer\'s first name might have been Charles rested on a speculative identification of <mask> with another composer found in the Chantilly Codex, Goscalch, "a rather German-sounding name" that might be an anagram of "Ch. Solag(e)". However, Reaney\'s claim that the name occurs nowhere apart from the Chantilly Codex has been proven wrong, as several other identifications have been found, and the possible identity of the two composers has been rejected.

Sheikh served as the Vice President of the Muslim World League with Faisal as President.

He was the first of the Parisian mimes of his era (the second was Deburau fils) to take his art abroad—to London, in late 1847, for a holiday engagement at the Adelphi—and, after triumphs in mid-century Paris at the Folies-Nouvelles, he entertained audiences in Cairo and Rio de Janeiro. In the last years of the century, he was a member of the Cercle Funambulesque, a theatrical society that promoted work, especially pantomime, inspired by the Commedia dell\'Arte, past and present. The year of his death coincided with the last year of the Cercle\'s existence. Life and career\nLike Deburau père, he was of humble birth—he was the son of a grocer in Saintes—but, unlike Deburau, whose vocation seems to have been chosen by his father, he was early drawn to the Parisian stage by an irresistible love of the theater. He made his debut in 1839 at the Concert Bonne-Nouvelle; there his "unique ambition", according to his biographer "J.M. ", "was, in this time of naïveté, to play the Lovers of vaudeville... "  When, later in that same year, he signed on with the management of the Théâtre des Funambules, where Deburau still held sway, it was as the "comic" of the vaudevilles and the lover, Leander, of the pantomimes.But it was Pierrot, according to Deburau\'s biographer, Tristan Rémy, "that better suited his fancy", and, after understudying the master for a half-dozen years, he appeared in the role in 1845, probably in the many revivals of old pantomimes. When Deburau died in 1846, he assumed the white blouse in all the new pieces. In the following year, however, Deburau\'s son, Jean-Charles ("Charles", as he preferred [1829–1873]), also made his debut as Pierrot at the same theater, an\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nCharles-Domin', '\nFrazer\n', '\nAtto\n\n', 'The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> was murdered in Barre, Vermont, United States on May 4, 1919.

Biography\n<mask> was born in Fulda, Germany, and educated at the University of Marburg and received a PhD from the University of Berlin in 1872. In 1874, he discovered that a point-contact semiconductor rectifies alternating current. He became director of the Physical Institute and professor of physics at the University of Strassburg in 1895. In 1897, he built the first cathode-ray tube (CRT) and cathode ray tube oscilloscope. The CRT became the cornerstone in developing fully electronic television.It is still sometimes called the "<mask> tube" in German-speaking countries (Braunsche Röhre) and other countries such as Korea (브라운관: Buraun-kwan) and Japan (ブラウン管: Buraun-kan). During the development of radio, he also worked on wireless telegraphy. In 1897, <mask> joined the line of wireless pioneers. His major contributions were the introduction of a closed tuned circuit in the generating part of the transmitter, its separation from the radiating part (the antenna) by means of inductive coupling, and later on the usage of crystals for receiving purposes. Around 1898, he invented a crystal detector. Wireless telegraphy claimed Dr. <mask>\'s full attention in 1898, and for many years after that he applied himself almost exclusively to the task of solving its problems. Dr. <mask> had written extensively on wireless subjects and was well known through his many contributions to the Electrician and other scientific journals.In 1899, he would apply for the patent Wireless electro transmission of signals over surfaces. Also in 1899, he is said to have applied for a patent on Electro telegraphy by means of condensers and induction coils.\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nGugliel', '\nCruyff', '\nSeamster\n', '\nJohn Keltner', '\nGersht\n', '\nSchreiner\n', '\nGuggenheimer', '\nVosper\n', '\nEdie Adams\n', '\nGehlhaar', '\nRosanna Pans', '\nLinton\n\n', '\nMazrui', '\nMajor General William H', '\nFirmin\n', '\nLee P. <', '\nMaldonado', '\nThapar\n', '\nZerna M.', '\nE.

Maximilian I appointed him as governor of all Jews of Germany, a position which was confirmed after his death by his grandson, Charles V.\n\nHis stature among the Jews, and the protected status he gained for himself and for the Jews within the Holy Roman Empire, rested in part on his skills as an advocate and in part from the Jewish role in financing the expenses of the emperor. <mask> of Rosheim remains a major figure of the History of Jews in Alsace.

He also reigned as Emperor of Ethiopia (1936–1941) and King of the Albanians (1939–1943). During his reign of nearly 46 years, which began after the assassination of his father Umberto I, the Kingdom of Italy became involved in two world wars. His reign also encompassed the birth, rise, and fall of Italian Fascism and its regime. During the First World War, <mask> accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Paolo Boselli and named Vittorio Emanuele Orlando (the premier of victory) in his place. Despite being on the winning side of the First World War, Italy did not get all the territories which had been promised to it in the 1915 Treaty of London; the Treaty of Versailles, ending the war, failed to give Italy its demands for Fiume and Dalmatia. This mutilated victory led to the resignation of Orlando.Domestically, the loss of these territories proved to be politically disastrous for Orlando's several short-serving successors. As a result, even the well-respected Giovanni Giolitti, serving an unprecedented fifth term as prime minister, could not unify the country in the face of the growing Facist movement. Strengthened by the economic downturn facing the country, the Fascists led the March on Rome, and the king appointed Benito Mussolini as prime minister. <mask> remained silent on the domestic political abuses of the Fascist regime, though he accepted the additional crowns of the Emperor of Ethiopia and the King of Albania as a result of Mussolini's colonial exploits. When Mussolini attempted to bring Italy into World War II in 1939, <mask> overrode him, and continued to resist Italian entry into the war until June, 1940, when the King relented and granted Mussolini sweeping powers to enter and conduct the war.

He is best known for a cycle of nine paintings, The Legend of Saint Ursula. His style was somewhat conservative, showing little influence from the Humanist trends that transformed  Italian Renaissance painting during his lifetime. He was influenced by the style of Antonello da Messina and Early Netherlandish art. For this reason, and also because so much of his best work remains in Venice, his art has been rather neglected by comparison with other Venetian contemporaries, such as Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione.

His date of birth is uncertain: his principal works were executed between 1490 and 1519, ranking him among the early masters of the Venetian Renaissance, and he is first mentioned in 1472 in a will of his uncle Fra Ilario. Upon entering the Humanist circles of Venice, he changed his  name to <mask>, an italianized form of Scarpanza. After signing an early work "Vetor Scarpanzo," he used variants of the Latin "Carpatio" or "Carpathius" for the rest of his career. He was a pupil (not, as sometimes thought, the master) of Lazzaro Bastiani, who, like the Bellini and Vivarini, was the head of a large atelier in Venice. Work\n\nCarpaccio\'s earliest known solo works are a Salvator Mundi in the Collezione Contini Bonacossi and a Pietà now in the Palazzo Pitti. These works clearly show the influence of Antonello da Messina and Giovanni Bellini – especially in the use of light and colors – as well as the influence of the schools of Ferrara and Forlì.In 1490 <mask> began the famous Legend of St. Ursula, for the Venetian \n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nCarpaccio', '\nArad\n\n', '\n<mask> of', '\nBiedermann\n', '\nWyllys\n', '\nSir Richard Francis Burton', '\nHazare\n', '\nCorning\n\n', '\nGoren\n\n', "The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> (née Palmieri; June 29, 1943) is an American educator and businesswoman serving as the U.S. representative for, which encompasses much of the northwestern portion of the state and the Gastonia area. <mask> is a member of the Republican Party and served as Secretary of the House Republican Conference from 2013 to 2017.

Life\nHe was probably born on 6 March 1613/1614, the younger son of <mask>, an alderman of Boston, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Eton and in 1634 went as a King\'s Scholar to King\'s College, Cambridge, becoming a BA in 1638 and an MA in 1642, and then a Fellow of his college until his death. According to <mask> he\n\n"closed with the Presbyterian in the beginning of the rebellion, took the covenant, sided with the Independents, became a great creature of the long parliament by whose authority he was made tutor to James, Duke of York), and an active person against his sovereign". His appointment as tutor dated from 1646. James, Duke of York was the future King James. He also tutored James\'s brother Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester.Ascham\'s reward for his support of the republican Commonwealth was to be appointed as a trade representative to the Hanseatic League in Hamburg in 1649. In 1650, he was appointed to represent the Commonwealth of England in Spain, but he never presented his credentials to the Court as he was murdered by a group of six Royalists émigrés in an Inn in Madrid on 27 May. Accounts of the subsequent trial by Agustin de Hierro were published in English and Spanish, and by Vicente Bañuelos in Spanish. Works\nIn 1647 Ascham prepared a manuscript treatise On Marriage that remained unpublished. His first published work was A Discourse, wherein is examined what is particularly lawfull during the Confusions and Revolutions of. This appeared in 1648, probably in July at the height of the political uncertainty engendered by the second Civil War. The previous month the Army had shown that it wielded both political and military power and Ascham\'s Discourse was widely seen as a defence of the Army as the conquering power, and as a plea for "the rank of the people" to adopt a position of political quiescence.Parliament\'s ultimate victory and the establishment\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \n<mask>\n', '\nLaura Codru', '\nSantokhi', '\nKevorkian', '\nTiina Klavan', 'The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> of Bouillon (,,, ; 18 September 1060 – 18 July 1100) was a French nobleman and pre-eminent leader of the First Crusade. He was the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1099 to 1100. He avoided using the title of king, choosing instead that of princeps. Older scholarship is more fond of another title, that of Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (Defender of the Holy Sepulchre), a secondary title which is still preferred by the Catholic Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. The second son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, <mask> became Lord of Bouillon (from which he took his byname) in 1076 and secured his rights to the Duchy of Lower Lorraine in 1087 as a reward to his service to the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV during the Great Saxon Revolt. <mask> and his brothers Eustace III and Baldwin of Boulogne joined the First Crusade in 1096. He saw minor action at Nicaea, Dorylaeum and Antioch, before playing a key role during the successful Siege of Jerusalem in 1099.Raymond IV of Toulouse declined the offer to become king of Jerusalem, and <mask> accepted the rulership instead. He refused the title of king, however, as he believed that he ought not wear "a crown of gold" where Jesus Christ had worn "a crown of thorns". <mask> secured his kingdom by defeating the Fatimids at Ascalon a month later, bringing the First Crusade to an end. <mask> only ruled Jerusalem for one year before his death in 1100. He was succeeded by his brother Baldwin, who was crowned the first king of Jerusalem. Early life\n<mask> of Bouillon was born around 1060 as the second son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, and Ida, daughter of the Lotharingian duke <mask> the Bearded and his first wife, Doda. His birthplace was probably Boulogne-sur-Mer, although one 13th-century chronicler cites Baisy, a town in what is now Walloon Brabant, Belgium.As second son, he had fewer opportunities than his older brother.

He is most notable for leading the Russian polar expedition of 1900–1902 in search of the legendary Sannikov Land, a phantom island purported to lie off Russia\'s Arctic coast. During the expedition, <mask> and a small party of explorers disappeared from Bennett Island, and their fate remains unknown to this day. Early life\n<mask> was born on, in Reval of the Governorate of Estonia (now Tallinn, Estonia). He belonged to the Baltic German noble Toll family and was married to Emmeline "Emmy" Magdalene. His family\'s origin was debated, but genealogists had suggested them to be of Hollandish origin and was originated in Leiden. He was a close relative of the Middendorff family, and one of the Toll\'s teachers was the academician of the Imperial Academy of Sciences <mask>f.<mask> graduated from the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu) as a zoologist in 1882. Already while he was a student he traveled to the Mediterranean and researched the fauna, flora and geology of Algeria and the Balearic Islands.

In 1886 <mask> thought that he had seen an unknown land north of Kotelny. He guessed that this was the so-called "Zemlya Sannikova" (Sannikov Land), a land that Yakov Sannikov and Matvei Gedenschtrom claimed to have seen during their 1808-1810 expedition, but whose existence had never been proved. <mask> was among the first to report in detail about the abundance of Pleistocene fossils found within Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, one of the New Siberian Islands.Under a peat composed of water mosses covering what he described as \n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nAlexander Bunge\n', '\nKanapyanov', '\nII of Aves', '\nTimocreon\n', '\nHunn\n\n', '\nSamba wa Mb', '\nRuly Carpent', "The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> (March 19, 1929 – May 8, 1995) was an American basketball player.

After his high school career, <mask> was recruited by the University of Kentucky. During his time with the Wildcats, he led the team to the 1951 NCAA Tournament championship, and was voted Most Outstanding Player of the event. When a point shaving scandal was revealed that year, <mask> was accused of being involved, which he denied. He left the Wildcats in December 1951, and the university banned him from the squad in March 1952. After he testified before a grand jury in New York, he was indicted on perjury charges.Although <mask> was not convicted when the case went to trial in 1953, he was prevented from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward. <mask> instead played professionally for various minor league teams. In 10 Eastern Basketball League (EBL) seasons, his teams won three championships. <mask> retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years.

Inglis was born into a naval family, the son of an officer who would die a rear-admiral, and followed his father into the navy. He rose through the ranks, and was a lieutenant aboard a frigate by 1798, when his ship fought an action against a French frigate, and succeeded in capturing it. Inglis had to take over command during the battle when his captain was injured, and was subsequently highly praised for his efforts. He then went to the Mediterranean, serving on a frigate forming part of Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron. He again acquitted himself well in battle, when his ship attacked a much larger French warship, delaying her enough for more British ships to arrive on the scene and force her surrender. Nelson himself congratulated Inglis for his part.Promoted to commander, and then captain, Inglis commanded several small cruisers, before becoming flag captain to Rear-Admiral George Martin. It was the start of an enduring relationship, with Martin retaining Inglis to be his flag captain on all his flagships. He served in several further engagements with the French fleets in the Mediterranean during the war, and also off the coast of Portugal during Martin's time in command there. He returned to Martin's side as late as 1824, when Martin became Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth, flying his flag aboard, and with Inglis once more his flag captain. Stepping down on the expiration of Martin's post in 1827, Inglis died several years later, in 1833.

In 1534 <mask> changed his surname to Mauro Lyco (from the meaning of "occult wolf"), after having adopted for eight years, uninterruptedly, the name of Mauro Lycio ("occult Apollo") as a member of a Messina academy. Having already obtained priestly ordination since 1521 and, consequently, some ecclesiastical benefit, he was appointed abbot of the monastery of Santa Maria del Parto (in Castelbuono) in 1550 by Simone Ventimiglia marquis of Geraci, pupil and patron of Maurolico.

He received the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature "in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a Provençal philologist". Mistral was a founding member of the Félibrige and member of the Académie de Marseille. His name in his native language was <mask> (Mistrau) according to the Mistralian orthography or <mask> (or Mistrau) according to the classical orthography. Mistral\'s fame was owing in part to Alphonse de Lamartine who sang his praises in the 40th edition of his periodical  Cours familier de littérature, following the publication of Mistral\'s long poem Mirèio. Alphonse Daudet, with whom he maintained a long friendship, eulogized him in "Poet Mistral", one of the stories in his collection Letters from My Windmill (Lettres de mon moulin).

His mother was Adelaide Poulinet. As early as 1471, his paternal ancestor, Mermet <mask>, lived in Maillane. By 1588, the Mistral family lived in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Mistral was given the Provençal name "Frederi" in memory "of a poor small fellow who, at the time when my parents were courting, sweetly ran their errands of love, and who died shortly afterward of sunstroke." Mistral did not begin school until he was about nine years, and quickly began to play truant, leading his parents to send him to a boarding school in Saint-Michel-de-Frigolet, run by a Monsieur Donnat.After receiving his bachelor\'s degree in Nîmes, Mistral studied law in Aix-en-Provence from 1848 to 1851.

He initially fought against the Romans during the First Jewish–Roman War as head of Jewish forces in Galilee, until surrendering in 67 CE to Roman forces led by Vespasian after the six-week siege of Yodfat. <mask> claimed the Jewish Messianic prophecies that initiated the First Jewish–Roman War made reference to Vespasian becoming Emperor of Rome. In response, Vespasian decided to keep Josephus as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became Emperor in 69 CE, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time <mask> assumed the emperor's family name of Flavius. <mask> fully defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and friend of Vespasian's son Titus, serving as his translator when Titus led the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE.Since the siege proved ineffective at stopping the Jewish revolt, the city's pillaging and the looting and destruction of Herod's Temple (Second Temple) soon followed. Josephus recorded Jewish history, with special emphasis on the first century CE and the First Jewish–Roman War (66–70 CE), including the siege of Masada. His most important works were The Jewish War (\xa075) and Antiquities of the Jews (\xa094). The Jewish War recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. Antiquities of the Jews recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide valuable insight into first century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity. Josephus's works are the chief source next to the Bible for the history and antiquity of ancient Palestine, and provide a significant and independent extra-Biblical account of such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, John the Baptist, James the Just, a\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nJosephus\n\n", '\nFlorizel Bo', '\nJohn Maulay', '\nNoel Edmond', '\nMorawetz,', '\nNjåstad', '\nStokley\n', '\nRaso\n', '\nShriver\n\n', 'The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> (sometimes read as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis I, Thothmes in older history works in Latinized Greek; Ancient Egyptian: ḏḥwtj-ms, Tʼaḥawtī-mīsaw,, meaning "Thoth is born") was the third pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. He received the throne after the death of the previous king, Amenhotep I. During his reign, he campaigned deep into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt farther than ever before in each region. He also built many temples in Egypt, and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings; he is the first king confirmed to have done this (though Amenhotep I may have preceded him). <mask> I\'s reign is generally dated to 1506–1493 BC, but a minority of scholars—who think that astrological observations used to calculate the timeline of ancient Egyptian records, and thus the reign of Thutmose I, were taken from the city of Memphis rather than from Thebes—would date his reign to 1526–1513 BC. He was succeeded by his son <mask> II, who in turn was succeeded by Thutmose II\'s sister, Hatshepsut. Family\n\nIt has been speculated that Thutmose\'s father was Amenhotep I.His mother, Senseneb, was of non-royal parentage and may have been a lesser wife or concubine. Queen Ahmose, who held the title of Great Royal Wife of Thutmose, was probably the daughter of Ahmose I and the sister of Amenhotep I; however, she was never called "king\'s daughter," so there is some doubt about this, and some historians believe that she was Thutmose\'s own sister. Assuming she was related to Amenhotep, it could be thought that she was married to Thutmose in order to guarantee succession. However, this is known not to be the case for two reasons. Firstly, Amenhotep\'s alabaster bark built at Karnak associates Amenhotep\'s name with Thutmose\'s name well before Amenhotep\'s death. Secondly, Thutmose\'s first-born son with Ahmose, Amenmose, was apparently born long before Thutmose\'s coronation.

Said to have been born on 15 April 1684 (o.s. 5 April), she was originally named Marta Helena Skowrońska which is a Polish spelling. Marta was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński (later spelt Samuil Skavronsky), a Roman Catholic farmer from the eastern parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, born to Minsker parents. In 1680 he married Dorothea Hahn at Jakobstadt. Her mother is named in at least one source as Elizabeth Moritz, the daughter of a Baltic German woman and there is debate as to whether Moritz's father was a Swedish officer.It is likely that two stories were conflated, and Swedish sources suggest that the Elizabeth Moritz story is probably incorrect. Some biographies state that Marta's father was a gravedigger and handyman, while others speculate that he was a runaway landless serf. Marta's parents died of the plague around 1689, leaving five children. According to one of the popular versions, at the age of three Marta was taken by an aunt and sent to Marienburg (the present-day Alūksne in Latvia, near the border with Estonia and Russia) where she was raised by Johann Ernst Glück, a Lutheran pastor and educator who was the first to translate the Bible into Latvian. In his household she served as a lowly servant, likely either a scullery maid or washerwoman. No effort was made to teach her to read and write and she remained illiterate throughout her life. Marta was considered a very beautiful young girl, and there are accounts that Frau Glück became fearful that she would become involved with her son.At the age of seventeen, she was married off to a Swedish dragoon, Johan Cruse or Johann Rabbe, with whom she remained for eight days in 1702, at which point the Swedish troops\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nMarta Helena", '\nCheong Wing F', '\nWolman\n\n', '\nBozell\n', '\nJohann Gott', '\nIrina Begu', '\nAnsaldo\n', '\nTyler Tolliver', '\nChadwick,', '\nJames "Jimmy', '\nJacoby Jacoby', '\nGiacomo da', '\nW.

Motorsport\nVandervell was the son of <mask>, founder of CAV, later Lucas CAV. He made his fortune from the production of Babbit Thin-Wall bearings by his company Vandervell Products, under licence from the American Cleveland Graphite Bronze Company. W. A. Robotham first met him about 1934 when Rolls-Royce was having bearing problems on Bentleys. He said that <mask> came across publicly as a "tough nut... spoiling for a fight" and his marital problems attracted publicity, but he was a true friend who would always come to the aid of staff as well as a successful industrialist of the sort that Britain could use more of. However he seemed to have a "persecution complex" and fell out with some friends. Having raced both motorcycles and cars a number of times in his younger days, soon after the end of World War II he acquired a Ferrari 125, powered by a 1.5-litre Colombo engine, which was altered by his mechanics and competed as the Thinwall Special, reflecting Vandervell\'s business empire.This was initially intended to be run as an evaluation of the Thinwall bearing, to be used as a research exercise by British Racing Motors (BRM). To that end, the car was a success, and Vandervell even provided a detailed critique of the car\'s flaws back to Enzo Ferrari himself. Between 1949 and 1953, there were four different Thinwall Specials. Though one of the first financial backers of BRM, Vandervell rapidly became disenchanted at the way in which Raymond Mays was running the team and in 1951, after the second Ferrari-based Thinwall Special had been evaluated, he decided to go his own way. He started to build a team, based in his Acton factory, that would be capable of designing and running its own 2.5L Formula One entry in 1954.

Ramakrishna approached his religious life through the path of devotion to the Goddess Kali, and by observance of various elements from Tantra, Vaishnav Bhakti, and Advaita Vedanta, as well as dalliances with Christianity and Islam. After earnest practice of various religious traditions, he held that the world\'s religions represented "so many paths to reach one and the same goal". His followers came to regard him as an avatara, or divine incarnation, as did some of the prominent Hindu scholars of his day. Ramakrishna, who experienced spiritual ecstasies from a young age, started his religious life as a priest at the Dakshineshwar Kali Temple. Soon his mystical temperament and spiritual nature, gained him widespread acknowledgement as a Guru, attracting to him various spiritual teachers, social leaders, Bengali elites, and lay followers alike; he eventually taught his disciples, who later formed the monastic Ramakrishna Order.

The uncle then sent Torricelli to Rome to study science under the Benedictine monk Benedetto Castelli, professor of mathematics at the Collegio della Sapienza (now known as the Sapienza University of Rome). Castelli was a student of Galileo Galilei. "Benedetto Castelli made experiments on running water (1628), and he was entrusted by Pope Urban VIII with hydraulic undertakings." There is no actual evidence that <mask> was enrolled at the university. It is almost certain that <mask> was taught by Castelli. In exchange he worked for him as his secretary from 1626 to 1632 in a private arrangement.Because of this, <mask> was exposed to experiments funded by Pope Urban VIII. While living in Rome, <mask> became also the student of the mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri, with whom he became great friends. It was in Rome that <mask> also became friends with two other students of Castelli, Raffaello Magiotti and Antonio Nardi.

He was an innovator of Russian music in the Romantic period. He strove to achieve a uniquely Russian musical identity, often in deliberate defiance of the established conventions of Western music. Many of his works were inspired by Russian history, Russian folklore, and other national themes. Such works include the opera Boris Godunov, the orchestral tone poem Night on Bald Mountain and the piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition. For many years, Mussorgsky\'s works were mainly known in versions revised or completed by other composers. Many of his most important compositions have posthumously come into their own in their original forms, and some of the original scores are now also available.Name\n\nThe spelling and pronunciation of the composer\'s name has caused some confusion. The family name derives from a 15th- or 16th-century ancestor, Roman Vasilyevich Monastyryov, who appears in the Velvet Book, the 17th-century genealogy of Russian boyars. Roman Vasilyevich bore the nickname "Musorga" (from, meaning\'music maker\'), and was the grandfather of the first Mussorgsky. The composer could trace his lineage to Rurik, the legendary 9th-century founder of the Russian state. In Mussorgsky family documents, the spelling of the name varies: "Musarskiy", "Muserskiy", "Muserskoy", "Musirskoy", "Musorskiy", and "Musurskiy". The baptismal record gives the composer\'s name as "Muserskiy". In early (up to 1858) letters to Mily Balakirev, the composer signed his name "Musorskiy" ().The "g" made its first appearance in a letter to Balakirev in 1863. <mask> used this new spelling (, Musorgskiy) to the end of his life, but occasionally reverted to the earlier "Musorskiy". The addition of the "g" to the name was likely initiated by the composer\'s elder brother Filaret to obscure the resemblance of the name\'s root to an unsavory Russian word:\n\nмусoр (músor) — n. m. debris, rubbish, refuse\n\nMussorgsky apparently d\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nMussorgsky', 'The following text talks about a person but the person is referred to as <mask>.\n\n<mask> (16 March 1862 – 7 August 1937) was a German General of the Cavalry in World War I.

Together, the two undertook extensive travels to the Middle East, India, Japan and China. In this function, on 7 November 1896, Stetten was promoted to Rittmeister. As such, he assumed command of a Squadron of the 2nd Royal Bavarian Chevau-légers "Taxis" on 6 November 1899, then stationed in Regensburg.

World War II\nAt the opening of hostilities in December 1941, <mask> was serving aboard. However, his squadron did not see combat in the early raids, as VF-2 was beached from 25 January 1942 in order to transition from the F2A Buffalo to the Grumman F4F Wildcat.Their place, in the meantime, was taken by the Grumman-equipped Fighting Squadron 3 (VF-3).

In positioning <mask> among catastrophists including Hans Bellamy, Ignatius Donnelly, and, the British astronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier noted "...\xa0Velikovsky is not so much the first of the new catastrophists\xa0...; he is the last in a line of traditional catastrophists going back to mediaeval times and probably earlier." <mask> argued that electromagnetic effects play an important role in celestial mechanics.He also proposed a revised chronology for ancient Egypt, Greece, Israel, and other cultures of the ancient Near East.

He was a low-ranking samurai from the Tosa Domain on Shikoku and became an active opponent of the Tokugawa Shogunate after the end of Japan's sakoku isolationist policy. Ryōma under the alias  worked against the Bakufu, the government of the Tokugawa shogunate, and was often hunted by their supporters and the Shinsengumi. Ryōma advocated for democracy, Japanese nationalism, return of power to the Imperial Court, abolition of feudalism, and moderate modernization and industrialization of Japan. Ryōma successfully negotiated the Satchō Alliance between the powerful rival Chōshū and Satsuma domains and united them against the Bakufu.

The illegitimate daughter of a Russian aristocrat and a German nurse, she had a comfortable upbringing but was marginalized within the Russian aristocracy due to the circumstances of her birth, leading to her interest in Marxism and the radical ideas of Nikolay Chernyshevsky. She entered into a marriage of convenience with Mikhail Tomanovski, a colonel who had retired early due to illness, in order to access her inheritance, which she used to fund revolutionary causes such as the Russian-language journal Narodnoye delo. Her money and married status allowed her to leave Russia and study in Geneva, where she participated in founding the Geneva section of the International Workingmen\'s Association. Sent by the Geneva section as an envoy to London, she became close to Karl Marx and his daughter Jenny. When the revolutionary Paris Commune was declared following the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, Marx sent Dmitrieff to Paris as a representative of the International.

For the following year they rented a single room from a farmer in the neighbouring countryside, where the young Pavarotti developed an interest in farming. After abandoning the dream of becoming a football goalkeeper, Pavarotti spent seven years in vocal training.

Croesus was renowned for his wealth; Herodotus and Pausanias noted that his gifts were preserved at Delphi. The fall of Croesus had a profound effect on the Greeks, providing a fixed point in their calendar. "By the fifth century at least," J. A. S. Evans has remarked, "Croesus had become a figure of myth, who stood outside the conventional restraints of chronology." Name\nThe name of Croesus was not attested to in contemporary inscriptions in the Lydian language. In 2019, D. Sasseville and K. Euler published a research of Lydian coins apparently minted during his rule, where the name of the ruler was rendered as Qλdãns.The name Croesus comes from the Latin transliteration of the Greek , which was itself the ancient Hellenic adaptation of the Lydian name . is a compound term consisting of the proper name , of a glide  () and of the Lydian term , meaning "master, lord, noble". According to J. M. Kearns, Croesus\'s real personal name would have been, while  would have been a honorific name meaning "The noble Karoś". Legendary biography\nThe dynasty which preceded that of Croesus on the throne of Sardis traced their descent from Alcaeus, the son of Hercules by Omphale, Queen of Lydia, during her year of required servitude. Croesus, like his ancestor Hercules, attempted to burn himself on a pyre when the Persians captured Sardis. By emulating the Greek myth, he demonstrated he had – or believed he had – Greek heritage. Aside from a poetical account of Croesus on the pyre in Bacchylides (composed for Hiero of Syracuse, who won the chariot race at Olympia in 468), there are three classical accounts of Croesus: firstly, Herodotus presents the Lydian accounts of the conversation with Solon (Histories 1.29–33), the tragedy of Croesus\' son Atys (Histories 1.34–45) and the fall of Croesus (Historie\n\nThe name of the person in the text referred to as <mask> is: \nCroesus\n', '\nKiefer\n', '\nDr. Hersh', '\nAarset,', '\nReno Lamas', '\nTanglefoot\n', '\nGlitsos\n', '\nDuponte\n', '\nGreaney\n\n', '\nChristian Mafi', '\nSandy Weill', '\nJörgensmann', '\nMetesky\n', '\nJammes ', '\nPenelope Renton', '\nTyrol\n\n', '\nGrozde\n']
